**Response:**

Okay, let's tackle swapping out that Skoda Slavia engine! It’s a significant undertaking, but with careful planning and execution, it’s definitely achievable. Replacing the engine in a Skoda Slavia involves several steps – let’s break it down systematically.

**1. Determining the Engine Type & Compatibility**

First, we need to understand exactly what engine you’re swapping. The Slavia currently uses a 2.0L turbocharged engine, but this information is crucial.  It’s important to verify that the rotary engine you’re considering is specifically designed to fit your vehicle.  The original engine’s specifications are vital to ensure a proper and safe fit.  You can find this information on the official Skoda website – [https://www.skoda.com/en/](https://www.skoda.com/en/). Also, you’ll want to check with a qualified mechanic specializing in Skoda engines for confirmation.

**2. Finding the Correct Parts**

Once we know the engine type, we can start sourcing the correct replacement parts. The rotary engine requires substantial modifications to fit in the vehicle's chassis. You'll likely need a complete engine kit – this typically includes the engine block, cylinder head, crankshaft, connecting rods, oil pump, and potentially other components.  The parts list is best found on reputable automotive parts websites. For example, you can check out: [https://www.amazon.in/s?k=engine+kit](https://www.amazon.in/s?k=engine+kit)

**3. Removing the Old Engine**

This is where it gets a bit involved. Here's a general outline of the process:

*   **Safety First:** Disconnect the battery and pull over to a safe location.
*   **Disconnect Wiring and Hoses:** Carefully disconnect all electrical connectors and hoses connected to the old engine. Document everything before disconnecting!
*   **Remove Engine Mounts:** Remove the engine mounts.
*   **Remove the Engine:** This is the most challenging part. It involves removing bolts, possibly some of the engine mounting brackets. It may require some specialized tools.  Refer to a service manual – [https://www.amazon.in/Manual/s?k=service+manual](https://www.amazon.in/Manual/s?k=service+manual) – for a detailed guide on this process.
*   **Disconnect Exhaust and Fuel Lines:**  Disconnect the exhaust and fuel lines – these are critical to prevent leaks.

**4. Required Tools/Parts – (Amazon Links)**

*   **Engine Blocks:** (https://www.amazon.in/s?k=engine+blocks) –  A replacement engine block will be needed.
*   **Cylinder Heads:** (https://www.amazon.in/s?k=cylinder+heads) – These will need to match the engine's design.
*   **Crankshaft:** (https://www.amazon.in/s?k=crankshaft) –  A new crankshaft is essential.
*   **Connecting Rods & Pistons:** (https://www.amazon.in/s?k=connecting+rods+pistons) – These need to be specifically matched to the new engine.
*   **Oil Pump:** (https://www.amazon.in/s?k=oil+pump) – Ensures proper lubrication.
*   **Tools:** Socket Set, Wrenches, Torque Wrench, Jack, Jack Stands, Drain Pan, Zip Ties.
*   **Heat Shielding:** (https://www.amazon.in/s?k=heat+shielding) –  Important for preventing heat damage to the chassis.
