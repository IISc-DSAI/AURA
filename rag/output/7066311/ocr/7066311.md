# BMW Ultimate Service™M

BMW Ultimate Service leads the industry in providing owners with incredible value and peace of mind. This service includes:

$\triangleright$ The BMW Maintenance Program: No cost factory-recommended maintenance for 4 years/50,000 miles from the original in-service date, whichever comes first.

$\triangleright$ BMW Roadside Assistance: No-cost 24/7 on-the-road assistance for 4 years/unlimited miles from the original in-service date. Also includes trip-interruption benefits as well as trip routing services.

$\triangleright$ New Vehicle Limited Warranty: Limited coverage for defects in materials and workmanship for 4 years/50,000 miles from the original in-service date, whichever comes first. Repairs will only be made at authorized BMW centers using Original BMW Parts.

# The BMW Maintenance Program

The BMW Maintenance Program is a benefit designed to help reduce the cost of ownership. This program has been devised with the following objectives: to maximize vehicle safety, reliability, and resale value by minimizing breakdowns resulting from wear, and minimizing cost and inconvenience by computing maintenance intervals based upon the specific manner in which each individual vehicle is driven.

A 2014 X1 vehicle purchased from an authorized BMW center in the United States (including Puerto Rico) is covered by the BMW Maintenance Program for 48 months or 50,000 miles, whichever occurs first. Coverage begins on the date of first retail sale or the date the vehicle is first placed into service as a sales demonstrator, Aftersales Mobility Program (AMP) Vehicle or BMiW Group company vehicle, whichever is earlier.

Any authorized BMW center in the United States (including Puerto Rico) will perform the scheduled and/or additional maintenance services on your vehicle at no expense to you so long as your vehicle qualifies for coverage under the BMW Maintenance Program.

# Coverage

The BMW Maintenance Program covers all factory recommended maintenance, as determined by the Condition Based Service (CBS) system. Additional specific items that need replacement due to normal wear and tear, and that are not covered by the original New Vehicle Limited Warranty - such as brake pads, brake rotors, and wiper blade inserts - are included, provided wear and tear exceeds BMW wear limits. Any applicable adjustments required due to normal operating conditions are also included. See pages 7-8 of this booklet for additional information.

Exclusions from coverage include the following:

$\triangleright$ Items reimbursable under your New Vehicle Limited Warranty   
$\triangleright$ Gasoline   
$\triangleright$ Gasoline additive   
$\triangleright$ Windshield washer additive (except when in conjunction with scheduled maintenance)   
$\triangleright$ Tires, wheel alignment, tire balance and rotation   
$\triangleright$ Parking brake shoes/linings   
$\triangleright$ Reset Tire Pressure Monitor   
$\triangleright$ Wear and tear of soft trim items, such as: seats, carpets, moldings, headliner, door panels and all chrome trim   
$\triangleright$ Damage, including consequential, which results from negligence, improper operation of the vehicle, wear and tear or deterioration due to driving habits or conditions, improper repair, environmental influences, flood, accident or fire damage, road salt corrosion, alteration, installation of non-genuine BMW accessories, or use of improper, poor quality or contaminated fuel   
$\triangleright$ Altered or unreadable Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) or odometer irregularities or vehicles where the true mileage cannot be determined   
$\triangleright$ Maintenance or repair after the vehicle is deemed a total loss   
$\triangleright$ Maintenance or repairs performed by other than an authorized BMW center within the United States (including Puerto Rico)   
$\triangleright$ "Topping off" low fluids (e.g., engine oil, antifreeze, washer fluid, etc.) except when done in conjunction with a scheduled maintenance or other required maintenance work (as outlined in the customized maintenance checklist printout) that is performed during an applicable Maintenance Program period   
$\triangleright$ Vehicles used in competitive events   
$\triangleright$ Oil changes performed outside the recommended maintenance intervals as indicated by the Condition Based Service

# Maintenance Upgrade Option

Please contact your authorized BMW center for information regarding the purchase of optional Maintenance Program Upgrades. Eligibility and coverage exclusions may apply.

# Intervals

Time intervals should be followed using the maintenance intervals as indicated by the BMW Condition Based Service.

Maintenance intervals on motor vehicles have conventionally been specified based upon accumulated mileage. However, driving conditions have a major influence on routine maintenance requirements; distance traveled is only one of the significant factors. A vehicle driven for 50,000 miles of short trips in the city with numerous cold starts, prolonged periods of idling, stop-and-go driving, and high engine speeds during acceleration requires more frequent maintenance intervals than a vehicle driven for 50,000 miles for long distances at low engine speeds primarily at operating temperature.

The advanced technologies at BMW have led to the development of the unique BMW Condition Based Service (CBS) system which computes the actual optimum maintenance requirements based not only upon the accumulated mileage, but taking into account important factors such as high or low engine speeds, short or long trip driving.

# Condition Based Service (CBS)

CBS is a further development of the Service Interval Indicator System.

The remaining times for selected maintenance tasks as well as any legally prescribed dates are displayed to you individually:

$\triangleright$ Engine oil   
$\triangleright$ Brakes - front and rear separately   
$\triangleright$ Brake fluid   
$\triangleright$ Vehicle check   
$\triangleright$ Required State Inspection(s)

CBS thus determines the current and future maintenance requirements. This data can also be read from the vehicle key by your BMW Service Advisor and used to propose the optimum scope of maintenance.

Disconnecting the battery during periods of long-term storage will interrupt the calculation of time-based services. BMW recommends that you have all items requiring time-based maintenance, such as brake fluid and possibly also the engine oil and microfilter, brought up to date by your authorized BMW center. Also see the section on battery care on page 9 of this Booklet.

# Special Note  Maintenance Intervals

The maintenance requirements for your vehicle are determined dynamically by the Condition Based Service (CBS) system. The maintenance items stated herein reflect the latest information available at the time of the printing of this Booklet, and are subject to change.

2014 X1 vehicles built prior to July 2013 utilized a different CBS "connected service item" interval as detailed on page 9.

The completion of certain subsequent maintenance items or services, as required to properly maintain your vehicle, will be specified at intervals computed by the BMW Condition Based Service system as follows:

$\triangleright$ Oil Service: Engine oil should be changed with the engine at operating temperature.

All 2014 model year X1 vehicles are factory-filled with BMW High Performance Synthetic oils. We recommend BMW High Performance 5W-30 Synthetic Oil (BMW part number 07 51 0 017 866) for regular scheduled engine oil changes.

BMW recommends that you check your engine oil level whenever you add fuel to your vehicle. For information on checking your engine oil level, refer to your vehicle's Owner's Manual.

If you need to add oil between oil changes and BMW High Performance Synthetic Oil is unavailable, for the purpose of topping up the engine oil level only, BMW recommends use of one of the below-listed synthetic oils:

The synthetic oils listed below meet BMW's   
Long-life rating LL01 (API rating SL):   
$\triangleright$ Castrol Syntec European Formula SAE OW-30   
$\triangleright$ Mobil 1 SAE 0W-40   
$\triangleright$ Pennzoil Platinum European Formula Ultra SAE 5W-30   
$\triangleright$ Valvoline SynPower SAE 5W-30

The choice of the right SAE grade is based on the climatic conditions in the region in which you normally drive your BMW. To best determine which SAE grade is best suited for your vehicle, contact an authorized BMW center.

If you are unable to obtain a recommended synthetic oil from the list above, for the purpose of topping up the engine oil level only, use only a synthetic oil with an API rating of SM or higher.

The following maintenance services: - Brake Fluid Service; - Intake Air Cleaner Service;

- Oxygen Sensor Service; - Spark Plug Service; - Ventilation Microfilter Service, must be performed when required as indicated by the following as applicable:

$\triangleright$ The specified CBS engine oil service counter interval   
$\triangleright$ The time interval (the first occurrence based on the vehicle's production date)   
$\triangleright$ The stated mileage for a "non-connected" maintenance service

Refer to pages 7 - 9 for additional information.

Additionally,

- The engine coolant has a long-term rating and does not need to be changed except for system repairs.

The automatic transmission installed in the BMWs covered in this publication contain transmission oil with a long-term rating. The oil does not need to be changed except for repairs.

For your convenience, you may also wish to have your authorized BMW center perform any necessary operations to fulfill any state inspection requirements in your area, concurrent with the maintenance services specified above during other repairs. Should you request more frequent maintenance service, the cost of these services will not be covered by the Maintenance Program.

BMW has applied the most modern technological advances not only to the design and production of your vehicle, but also to computing of the optimum maintenance interval for your type of operations and driving style. Your authorized BMW center has made a substantial investment in unique BMW special service tools to enable BMW factory trained service technicians to perform quality repairs on your BMW in minimal time, to help maximize your satisfaction with your BMW, its longevity, and resale value.

For a detailed list of items inspected, refer to the Quality Certification I form provided to the Owner at time of delivery. A copy of the form is on file at the selling authorized BMW center.

# Fuel Quality - Gasoline

Only use fuels advertised to have adequate detergency and low alcohol (such as ethanol) content. Please refer to your owner's manual for important information on the fuel recommended for use in your vehicle. Use of fuels with insufficient detergent and/or excess alcohol can cause driveability problems that necessitate cleaning intake valves and fuel injection valves, and, when applicable, adjusting the engine idle. We suggest having this work performed by your authorized BMW center, perhaps while regular maintenance is performed. Your authorized BMW center can also recommend a gasoline additive that will provide sufficient detergency. This recommended unscheduled maintenance which may be necessitated by use of inappropriate fuels is not required in order to maintain the emission warranty. It also is not covered by your vehicle's warranty because no defect in material or workmanship or component failure is involved.

# Maintenance Service Summary

The Condition Based Service (CBS) system will determine the requirement for performing the maintenance services described in this section, ending on page 8. These services may be required either individually or in conjunction with other maintenance services.

Maintenance services are performed as outlined in this section, based on intervals of either time, mileage or after performing a specified number of previous services. These intervals correspond to the latest information available when this Booklet was printed. Maintenance intervals are subject to change with newer vehicles or may also apply retroactively. Your authorized BMW center will be able to advise and perform maintenance services as required by the most recent information that applies to your vehicle.

# Battery Care

If your vehicle is driven only for short distances of less than 10 miles over a prolonged period of time, without an occasional drive at highway speeds, the engine's charging system will not maintain the battery. Insufficient use of the vehicle could result in short term starting problems and, in the long term, could damage the battery.

In case the vehicle is not operated for several weeks, it is advisable to:

$\triangleright$ consider using a proper trickle charger, following the charger manufacturer's instructions, to maintain the battery's state of charge; or $\triangleright$ consult your authorized BMW center regarding battery removal. Once removed, the battery must be charged and stored in a cool, dry place where it can be protected from freezing. If the battery will be stored for over 3 months, it must be recharged every 3 months, or else it will become damaged and useless.

Please consult with your authorized BMW center for further guidance and information.

# Corrosion Protection

Extensive corrosion protection measures implemented by BMW now make it possible to offer a 12-year unlimited mileage anti-corrosion warranty against rust perforation on your vehicle provided that the vehicle is properly maintained. Information on proper maintenance is available in this Booklet and your vehicle's Owner's Manual.

The major degree of corrosion protection is due to the electrophoretic dip painting process which cathodically deposits paint particles on all body parts, attracting paint particles into the minutest cavities or seams. Body parts are designed to provide optimum corrosion protection.

During manufacture, metal exterior body parts receive an additional corrosion protection coat. Hood, trunk, doors and other body parts are coated with PVC and sealed from the outside.

All floor panels receive a resilient coating of PVC for maximum protection against damage due to stones, etc.

Corrosion protection materials tested over many years are applied to the surfaces of cavities and to the entire underside of the vehicle during and after assembly.

For additional information on the 12-year unlimited mileage anti-corrosion warranty see the Warranty Section of this Booklet (page 20).

# Restoring corrosion protection

Please take care that anti-corrosion material is replaced when your vehicle is repaired after body or chassis damage.

BMW will not accept any liability for repair of, or damage caused by, any parts and accessories not approved by BMW.

# Underbody maintenance

The underbody has to be cleaned at least once a year, in Spring, with plain water in order to remove mud, chemical sediments and other deposits. If those materials are not removed, corrosion (rust) will occur on metal components.

Your authorized BMW center can do this anti-corrosion service for you.

Do not apply additional undercoating or rust-proofing on or near the exhaust   
manifold, exhaust pipes, catalytic converter or heat   
shields. During driving, the substance used for   
undercoating could overheat and cause a fire.

However, the cost of such service or parts will not be covered under this warranty, except in emergency situations. In an emergency situation, where an authorized BMW center or a warranty replacement part is not reasonably available (within 30 days), repairs may be performed at any available service establishment using any equivalent part. BMW NA will reimburse the owner for such emergency repairs (including labor, parts and diagnosis not to exceed BMW NA rates for labor, parts, and diagnosis in said area) that are covered under this warranty. Replaced parts and paid invoices must be presented at an authorized BMW center as a condition of reimbursement for emergency repairs not performed by an authorized BMW center.

The use of replacement parts, which are not of equivalent quality, may impair the effectiveness of the emission control system.

BMW NA assumes no liability under this warranty with respect to parts other than genuine BMW parts.

Then, in accordance with the provisions of section 207(b) of the Clean Air Act, BMW NA warrants that if the vehicle is eligible for coverage under this warranty, any non-conformities in the vehicle, which cause it to fail an EPA-approved emissions test will, without charge for parts or labor (including diagnosis), be adjusted, repaired, or replaced, at the option of BMW NA to proper specifications, in order to make the vehicle comply with applicable emissions standards. The decision whether to adjust, repair or replace parts is solely the prerogative of BMW NA and must reasonably be expected to correct the failure of the warranted part.

Coverage begins on the date of first retail sale or the date the vehicle is first placed into service as a sales demonstrator, Aftersales Mobility Program (AMP) Vehicle or company vehicle, whichever is earlier. This warranty continues for a period of 2 years or 24,000 miles, whichever occurs first, except for specific emissions control components (as listed on page 24), for which the warranty period is 8 years or 80,000 miles, whichever occurs first.

This warranty is made subject to the terms and conditions that apply to the Emission Control System Warranty and the New Vehicle Limited Warranty.

Warranty repairs do not constitute an extension of the original limited warranty period for the vehicle or a part thereof.

No claim under this warranty will be denied on the basis of use of a properly installed EPA certified emission part for maintenance and repair.

A vehicle manufacturer may deny an emission performance warranty claim on the basis of an uncertified replacement part used in the maintenance or repair of a vehicle only if the vehicle manufacturer presents evidence that the uncertified replacement part is either defective in materials or workmanship or not equivalent from an emission standpoint to the original equipment part.

# Maintenance, replacement, or repair of emission control devices and systems may be performed by any automotive repair establishment or individual using any certified part.

Immediately after the vehicle has failed an EPA approved emission short test, your claim can be made at any authorized BMW center. The authorized BMW center will honor or deny your claim within the time period specified by local or state laws (not to exceed 30 days), to avoid further penalties or sanctions. If the claim is denied, the authorized BMW center will notify you in writing of the reason(s). The authorized BMW center is required by law to honor the claim if notice of denial is not received by the owner within the specified time period.

You may obtain further information concerning the emission warranties, or report violations of warranty terms, by contacting the Director, Field Operations and Support Division (6406J), Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW, Washington, D.C. 20460.

# California Emission Control Warranty Statement\* Your Warranty Rights and Obligations

The California Air Resources Board and BMW of North America, LLC (BMW NA) are pleased to explain the emission control system warranty on your 2014 vehicle. In California, new motor vehicles must be designed, built and equipped to meet the State's stringent anti-smog standards. BMW NA must warrant the emission control system on your vehicle for the periods of time listed below provided there has been no abuse, neglect or improper maintenance of your vehicle.

\*The California Emissions Control System Limited Warranty applies to all 201 4 U.S.- specification BMW vehicles registered in California, Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont or Washington.

Your emission control system may include parts such as the fuel injection system, the ignition system, catalytic converter, and engine computer. Also included may be hoses, belts, connectors and other emission-related assemblies.

Where a warrantable condition exists, BMW NA will repair your vehicle at no cost to you including diagnosis, parts and labor.

# Manufacturer's Warranty Coverage:

- For 3 years or 50,000 miles, whichever occurs first:

1 If your vehicle fails a Smog Check inspection, all necessary repairs and adjustments will be made by BMW NA to ensure that your vehicle passes the inspection. This is your emission control system PERFORMANCE WARRANTY.

2. If any emission-related part on your vehicle is defective, the part will be repaired or replaced by BMW NA. This is your short-term emission control system DEFECTS WARRANTY.

- For 8 years or 100,000 miles, whichever occurs first:

If an emission-related part specially noted on page 29 as having coverage for 8 years or 100,000 miles is defective, the part will be repaired or replaced by BMW NA. This is your long-term emission control system DEFECTS WARRANTY.

Warranty repairs do not constitute an extension of the original limited warranty period for the vehicle or a part thereof.

# Owner's Warranty Responsibilities:

# California Emission Control System Limited Warranty\*

This warranty applies to California certified vehicles distributed by BMW of North America, LLC (BMW NA) or sold through the BMW NA European Delivery Program, registered and operated primarily in California.

\*The California Emissions Control System Limited Warranty applies to all 2014 U.S.- specification BMW vehicles registered in California, Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont or Washington.

BMW NA warrants to the original purchaser and each subsequent owner that the vehicle is:

a. designed, built and equipped so as to conform with the applicable California Air Resources Board emission standards.

b. free from defects in materials and workmanship which cause any part that can affect emissions to fail to conform with applicable requirements or to fail a California Smog Check test or EPA approved short test for a period of 3 years or 50,000 miles, whichever occurs first.

c. free from defects in materials and workmanship in emission related parts, which are contained in the California Emission Warranty Parts List on page 29, for a period of 8 years or 100,000 miles, whichever occurs first.

Coverage begins on the date of first retail sale or the date the vehicle is first placed into service as a sales demonstrator, Aftersales Mobility Program (AMP) Vehicle or company vehicle, whichever is earlier.

To obtain service under this warranty, the vehicle must be brought, upon failure of a Smog Check test or upon discovery of the defect, to the workshop of any authorized BMW center, during normal business hours. The authorized BMW center will honor or deny your claim within 30 days. If the claim is denied, the authorized BMW center will notify you in writing of the

reason(s). The authorized BMW center is required by law to honor the claim if notice is not given to the owner within 30 days.

The authorized BMW center will, without charge for parts or labor (including diagnosis), either adjust, repair or replace the defective part and other parts affected by the failure of the warranted part, if any. If your vehicle failed the California Smog Check test or an EPA approved short test, then BMW NA will repair your vehicle so that it will pass this test. Items that require scheduled replacement are warranted up to the replacement interval specified in the Service section of this Statement. BMW NA may repair a part in lieu of replacing it when performing warranty repairs. Parts for which replacements are made become the property of BMW NA. After 3 years or 50,000 miles, and in accordance with paragraph (c) above, such repairs are limited to the repair or replacement of those parts identified in the California Emissions Warranty List.

If your California registered vehicle is between 7 and 8 years old and has been driven less than 80,000 miles, then your vehicle is eligible for additional warranty coverage under the Federal Emissions Warranty.

A repair performed as the result of a Smog Check test failure due to a defect in a part, which is warranted for 8 years/100,000 miles, is covered.

Warranty repairs do not constitute an extension of the original limited warranty period for the vehicle or a part thereof.

In all cases, a reasonable time, not to exceed 30 days, must be allowed for a warranty repair to be completed, after the vehicle is received by the authorized BMW center.

It is the owner's responsibility to have all required maintenance services performed (at the owner's expense), as prescribed in the maintenance schedule for the BMW Emission Control System. Service intervals are computed by the Condition Based Service system and displayed on the instrument panel.

However, BMW NA will not deny your warranty repair claims solely because you do not have maintenance records or you did not perform the required maintenance unless BMW NA demonstrates that such lack of required maintenance is a direct cause of the emission control system failure. The instructions for required maintenance and use can be found in the Owner's Manual and in the Service section of this Statement.

It is strongly recommended that any replacement parts used for maintenance, repair or replacement of emission control systems be genuine BMW Service Parts or BMW Authorized Remanufactured Parts. Without invalidating this warranty, the owner may elect to have maintenance, repair or replacement of the emission control systems performed by any automotive repair establishment, or elect to use parts other than BMW Authorized Remanufactured or genuine BMW Service Parts. However, the cost of such service or parts will not be covered under this warranty, except in emergency situations. In an emergency situation, where an authorized BMW center is not reasonably available or a warranty replacement par is not available within 30 days, repairs may be performed at any available service establishment or by any individual using any replacement part.

A repair not completed within 30 days constitutes an emergency. BMW NÁ will reimburse the owner for such emergency repairs (including labor, parts and diagnosis not to exceed BMW suggested retail price for all warranted parts replaced and labor charges based on the manufacturer's recommended time allowance for the warranty repair and the geographically appropriate hourly labor rate) that are covered under this warranty. Replaced parts and paid invoices must be presented to an authorized BMW center as a condition of reimbursement for emergency repairs not performed by an authorized BMW center.

The use of replacement parts, which are not of equivalent quality, may impair the effectiveness of emission control systems. If other than genuine BMW Service Parts or Authorized Remanufactured Parts are used for maintenance, repair or replacement of components affecting emission control, the owner should obtain assurances that such parts are warranted by their manufacturer to be equivalent to genuine BMW parts in performance and durability. BMW NA assumes no liability under this warranty with respect to parts other than genuine BMW parts.

However, the use of non-genuine BMW replacement parts does not invalidate the warranty on other components, unless non-genuine BMW parts cause damage to warranted parts.

# What is not covered

This warranty does not cover malfunctions caused by any of the following: accident, flood, misuse, modification, alteration, tampering, disconnection, improper or inadequate maintenance, except if performed by an authorized BMW center doing warranty repair work, use of leaded fuel or fuel other than as specified in the Owner's Manual.

The replacement of maintenance parts, such as spark plugs (gasoline engines only), filters and similar items used in required maintenance services or the repair or replacement of maintenance parts beyond the first replacement interval.

Any vehicle on which the odometer has been replaced or altered and the true mileage cannot be determined.

The vehicle, if the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) is altered or cannot be determined, or if the vehicle has been declared a total loss or sold for salvage purposes.

# General

The warranty gives you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights which vary from state to state.

THE DURATION OF ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, IS LIMITED TO THE DURATION OF THE EXPRESS WARRANTIES HEREIN.

BMW OF NORTH AMERICA, LLC (BMW NA) HEREBY EXCLUDES INCIDENTAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOSS OF TIME, INCONVENIENCE, OR LOSS OF USE OF THE VEHICLE, FOR ANY BREACH OF ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, APPLICABLE TO THIS PRODUCT.
