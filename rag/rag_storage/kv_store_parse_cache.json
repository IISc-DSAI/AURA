        "text": "Abstract—Issue tracking systems are used in the software industry for the facilitation of maintenance activities that keep the software robust and up to date with ever-changing industry requirements. Usually, users report issues that can be categorized into different labels such as bug reports, enhancement requests, and questions related to the software. Most of the issue tracking systems make the labelling of these issue reports optional for the issue submitter, which leads to a large number of unlabeled issue reports. In this paper, we present a state-of-the-art method to classify the issue reports into their respective categories i.e. bug, enhancement, and question. This is a challenging task because of the common use of informal language in the issue reports. Existing studies use traditional natural language processing approaches adopting key-word based features, which fail to incorporate the contextual relationship between words and therefore result in a high rate of false positives and false negatives. Moreover, previous works utilize a uni-label approach to classify the issue reports however, in reality, an issue-submitter can tag one issue report with more than one label at a time. This paper presents our approach to classify the issue reports in a multi-label setting. We use an off-the-shelf neural network called RoBERTa and fine-tune it to classify the issue reports. We validate our approach on issue reports belonging to numerous industrial projects from GitHub. We were able to achieve promising F-1 scores of $81 \\%$ , $74 \\%$ , and $80 \\%$ for bug reports, enhancements, and questions, respectively. We also develop an industry tool called Automatic Issue Classifier (AIC), which automatically assigns labels to newly reported issues on GitHub repositories with high accuracy. ",

However, the labels associated with the issue are optional. Issue submitter can choose these labels from the list of default issue labels such as 'bug', 'enhancement', 'documentation', and 'question' or it can be custom defined by the issue submitter. Additionally, the issue submitter can tag the issue report with multiple labels at a time. Labelling these issues enables the project team to prioritize these issues based on the label assigned. For example, while the software is close to a release, it might be important to make the software more robust instead of adding new features. While all these categorized issue reports help the software maintainers to identify, reproduce and finally make appropriate changes in the software, it also complicates the tasks for the software maintainer due to the inconsistent nature of labels. For instance, the bug-report label can be written in multiple ways such as 'bug', 'there is a bug' etc., which makes this a challenging task. Usually, software project repositories either rely on the issue-submitter to assign a label to the issue report based on their intuition or they rely on the software development team to manually classify these issues to their respective categories. The manual classification approach works well for repositories in which issues are reported with a low frequency. However, there are numerous popular repositories on GitHub which have a very large number of issues reported every day, making it a challenging task to manually label them. Also, labelling these issues on such repositories is a non-trivial task and generally requires specific domain knowledge and a thorough analysis of the body of the issue. ",

        "text": "Classification of GitHub issue reports has recently been of great interest as an enabling path for a more involved GitHubbased data analysis. However, the existing approaches to solve the issue report classification problem do not use advanced language modeling and rely on keyword-based approaches [2][6]. Traditional, keyword-based approaches suffer from a high false-positive and a high false-negative rate. This is because they view the problem as bag-of-words and are not aware of the full language model, hence they do not capture contextual relationships among the words [7]. Also, the existing studies view the problem as a multi-class classification problem that assumes an issue can be only associated with a single label. However, an issue submitter can tag the issue label with multiple labels at the same time. Therefore, we have to treat the issue classification problem as multi-label classification. In multi-label classification settings, an issue report can be associated with more than one label at a time. ",

RoBERTa is an optimized variant of BERT, which uses improved training methodology and larger data to achieve better results than BERT [9].

To train RoBERTa, we take the GitHub issue data set labeled with the 3 labels i.e. 'Bug', 'Enhancement', 'Question'. Here, we only used issues that are tagged with the default GitHub labels. As we are essentially performing transfer learning, we need significantly fewer data samples to build an accurate model as compared to millions of data examples required to train a model from scratch [7]. We evaluated our approach on approximately 55,000 randomly sampled issue reports associated with the top 200 repositories across 55 popular languages.

(3) Automatic Issue Classifier (AIC), a GitHub application which can be leveraged to classify GitHub issues-reports on any GitHub repository. Figure 1 shows the overview of our approach.

Secondly, the volume of each categorized issue report can help the project manager to review the project maintenance process at any point and make appropriate decisions. For instance, a large number of bug reports might indicate that the quality assurance process might need some help. Thirdly, having accurately categorized issue reports would help in routing the issue to the right software developer, who is working on the specific module/component. Also, accurately categorized issue reports can help the team leader to prioritize the tasks, and the release manager can figure out the way to stabilize the project. Lastly, the projects will be managed more efficiently and effectively, and ultimately would result in better products and projects. ",

Our model is able to well understand the context, hence provides accurate and efficient issue report classification. Our framework takes into account the non-exclusiveness of the issue-reports data and is capable of assigning multiple labels to issue reports at the same time. We extracted our data-set from GitHub repositories across the top 55 popular programming languages to ensure that our results and model are capable of generalizing across multiple languages. We evaluated our results over a data set containing three labels i.e., bugs, enhancement, and questions, and were able to achieve an F1 score of $81 \\%$ , $74 \\%$ , and $80 \\%$ respectively, which is comparable to existing issue classification results. We leveraged our state-of-the-art approach to develop an industry tool i.e. Automatic Issue Classifier that is capable of automatically labelling the issue reports. We believe that our tool will benefit the software engineering industry by enabling the teams to keep their focus on the necessary tasks by automating the manual task of labelling the issue reports.
