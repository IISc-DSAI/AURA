Usually, users report issues that can be categorized into different labels such as bug reports, enhancement requests, and questions related to the software. Most of the issue tracking systems make the labelling of these issue reports optional for the issue submitter, which leads to a large number of unlabeled issue reports. In this paper, we present a state-of-the-art method to classify the issue reports into their respective categories i.e. bug, enhancement, and question. This is a challenging task because of the common use of informal language in the issue reports. Existing studies use traditional natural language processing approaches adopting key-word based features, which fail to incorporate the contextual relationship between words and therefore result in a high rate of false positives and false negatives. Moreover, previous works utilize a uni-label approach to classify the issue reports however, in reality, an issue-submitter can tag one issue report with more than one label at a time. This paper presents our approach to classify the issue reports in a multi-label setting. We use an off-the-shelf neural network called RoBERTa and fine-tune it to classify the issue reports. We validate our approach on issue reports belonging to numerous industrial projects from GitHub. We were able to achieve promising F-1 scores of $81 \\%$ , $74 \\%$ , and $80 \\%$ for bug reports, enhancements, and questions, respectively. We also develop an industry tool called Automatic Issue Classifier (AIC), which automatically assigns labels to newly reported issues on GitHub repositories with high accuracy. \n\nIndex Terms—software maintenance, software quality, GitHub issue report classification \n\nI. INTRODUCTION \n\nSoftware maintenance refers to the changes made to the software in order to make it more robust, efficient, and to make it adaptable to a modified environment [1]. Issue tracking systems are one of the most critical means for the maintainers to enable rigorous yet effective software evolution tasks. Issue tracking systems allow the software developers to report, manage and keep track of the tickets [2]. They are capable of being the single point of reference for nearly all the maintenance activities such as resolving reported bugs, making the project more efficient, and adding new features. \n\nGitHub is a version control and source code management service, which empowers the users in several ways such as to host the source code, keeping track of versions, and release and maintain the software. It is the largest source code hosting platform with more than 50 million developers and more than 100 million public repositories 1 as of the year 2018. Similar to the other conventional bug-tracking systems such as Jira2, MantisBT3, and Zoho4, GitHub also provides an integrated issue tracking system. Using the GitHub issue tracking system, a user can interact with the maintainers of the repository. For instance, any user who wants to report a bug, request a new feature, or wants to ask questions related to the software might make use of the issue tracking system. \n\nTo create an issue report  in the GitHub issue tracker, users are required to provide a title and a brief description as the body. However, the labels associated with the issue are optional. Issue submitter can choose these labels from the list of default issue labels such as 'bug', 'enhancement', 'documentation', and 'question' or it can be custom defined by the issue submitter. Additionally, the issue submitter can tag the issue report with multiple labels at a time. Labelling these issues enables the project team to prioritize these issues based on the label assigned. For example, while the software is close to a release, it might be important to make the software more robust instead of adding new features. While all these categorized issue reports help the software maintainers to identify, reproduce and finally make appropriate changes in the software, it also complicates the tasks for the software maintainer due to the inconsistent nature of labels. For instance, the bug-report label can be written in multiple ways such as 'bug', 'there is a bug' etc., which makes this a challenging task. Usually, software project repositories either rely on the issue-submitter to assign a label to the issue report based on their intuition or they rely on the software development team to manually classify these issues to their respective categories. The manual classification approach works well for repositories in which issues are reported with a low frequency. However, there are numerous popular repositories on GitHub which have a very large number of issues reported every day, making it a challenging task to manually label them. Also, labelling these issues on such repositories is a non-trivial task and generally requires specific domain knowledge and a thorough analysis of the body of the issue. \n\nClassification of GitHub issue reports has recently been of great interest as an enabling path for a more involved GitHubbased data analysis. However, the existing approaches to solve the issue report classification problem do not use advanced language modeling and rely on keyword-based approaches [2][6]. Traditional, keyword-based approaches suffer from a high false-positive and a high false-negative rate. This is because they view the problem as bag-of-words and are not aware of the full language model, hence they do not capture contextual relationships among the words [7]. Also, the existing studies view the problem as a multi-class classification problem that assumes an issue can be only associated with a single label. However, an issue submitter can tag the issue label with multiple labels at the same time. Therefore, we have to treat the issue classification problem as multi-label classification. In multi-label classification settings, an issue report can be associated with more than one label at a time. \n\nTo address the aforementioned problems, we used a transformer-based model called RoBERTa [8]. RoBERTa is an optimized variant of BERT, which uses improved training methodology and larger data to achieve better results than BERT [9]. RoBERTa has the ability to consider the contextual relationship between the word while making the prediction. To train RoBERTa, we take the GitHub issue data set labeled with the 3 labels i.e. 'Bug', 'Enhancement', 'Question'. Here, we only used issues that are tagged with the default GitHub labels. As we are essentially performing transfer learning, we need significantly fewer data samples to build an accurate model as compared to millions of data examples required to train a model from scratch [7]. We evaluated our approach on approximately 55,000 randomly sampled issue reports associated with the top 200 repositories across 55 popular languages. We were able to achieve promising results with an F1-Score nearing $80 \\%$ with significantly fewer training examples. \n\nIn our work, we tried to answer the following research questions: \n\n1)RQ1: Does the transformer-based approach out-perform the traditional keyword-based approaches at classifying GitHub issue reports?   \n2) RQ2: Does the transformer-based model have the ability to be incorporated into an industry-level tool? \n\nThis work has immediate benefits to the industry as it enables efficient tracking of issue reports on GitHub. First, it can help the software development team track the software maintenance process effectively. Secondly, the categorized issue classification can help in effective development documentation that can help the project team to achieve effective software maintenance. Thirdly, having accurately categorized issue reports would help in routing the issue to the right software developer, who is working on the specific module. Lastly, categorized issue reports can help the project manager to optimize the resource allocation process, if a particular module is getting a lot of bug reports that implies the need of assigning resources for the purpose of improving the associated code-base. \n\nThe following is a summary of our contributions: \n\n• We present a transformer-based approach for classifying the GitHub issue reports in a multi-label setting. • We conducted our evaluation on GitHub issue-tracker dataset across 55 different programming languages. • We develop and release a tool, Automatic Issue Classifier (AIC) on top of our transfer-based approach. AIC is capable of being deployed in industrial-scale software repositories to automatically classifies issue reports as soon as they are reported. \n\nThis paper is organized as follows: Section II discusses the previous relevant studies. Section III discusses the methodology we used for the data collection, and issue report categorization. Section IV discusses the evaluation of our approach. Section V discusses the implication of these results in the industry. Section VI discusses the threats to validate the study. Section VII discusses the potential future avenues. Finally, section IX concludes the study. \n\nII. RELATED WORK \n\nPrevious studies in the domain of classification of issues on issue-trackers range from the binary classification of bugs/nonbugs to the categorization of issues using multi-class classification methods. Several research works have proposed methods ranging from using keyword-based approaches to sophisticated machine learning models. We discuss these studies and their limitations in order to lay the grounds for our research. \n\nAntoniol et al. [4] proposed a key-word based approach in order to distinguish bug issues from non-bug issues. They manually labeled 1,800 issues associated with repositories of Mozilla, Eclipse, and JBoss and further fed these issues to Alternating Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression-based models resulting in up to $82 \\%$ correct results. Our work proposes a multi-label method to classify these issues into three mutually exclusive labels. Additionally, we evaluate our results on a larger set of issues from a diverse set of repositories. \n\nKallis et al. [2] presented TicketTagger, a tool to categorize GitHub issues. They used a fastText [10] based model to classify the GitHub issue into bugs, enhancement, and questions categories. They were able to achieve an F1-score of $82 \\%$ over all three of the categories. They treated the issue classification problem as a multi-class problem where one issue can belong to a single label at a time. Our work used the same labels as used by Kallis et al. [2]. However, we solve this problem as a multi-label classification problem, where an issue report can have multiple labels at the same time. \n\nFan et al. [6] proposed a two-stage framework for classifying the issue reports. They perform their analysis on over 252,000 issue reports from 80 popular GitHub projects. Further, they compared their results with four traditional machine learning methods including Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Random Forest Tree, Support Vector Machine. Our work, in contrast, leverages the power of pre-trained transformerbased models which produce state-of-the-art results without requiring a large number of training examples. \n\nChawla et al. [3] proposed an automated approach to categorize the type of issue reports. They utilized a Fuzzy Logic based system to classify the issue types and evaluated their results on issue reports from HTTPClient, Jackrabbit, and Lucene. They were able to achieve an F-1 score of 0.83, 0.79, 0.84 for the three repositories, respectively. However, they evaluated their model on results on a limited number of well-maintained repositories which might be misleading. \n\nFazayeli et al. [5] used text-based classification to label GitHub issues. However, they only evaluated their framework for only a single repository i.e. 'git-for-windows'. Also, they treated the problem as a binary classification problem with bug and non-bug labels. However, our framework categorically attempts to assign multiple labels to a GitHub issue report. Also, we evaluated our approach on a diverse data set with projects from various programming languages. \n\nThe above-discussed studies utilized keyword-based features to categorize the issue reports, which suffer from a high rate of false positives. The primary reason of which is that they do not consider the contextual relationships between words while classification. Also, these studies treat the issue classification problem as a multi-class classification problem. However, in real-world scenarios, an issue can be associated with more than one label at a time and should be addressed as a multi-label classification problem. \n\nAttention-based networks derived from human intuition have resulted in significant improvement in various natural language processing tasks [11]. Attention-based networks are capable of focusing on context-relevant details in a given text while ignoring irrelevant keywords. Bahdanau et al. [12] were the first to introduce an attention mechanism for the purpose of machine translation, commonly referred to as additive attention. Recent advancements in NLP has led to wide adoption of self-attention based Transformers [13] models. Pre-trained transformers are trained on a large natural language corpus and further, they can be fine-tuned for the downstream NLP tasks such as machine translation, and text classification. \n\nIn recent work, Devlin et al. [14] introduced Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding (BERT) which leverages the Transformer-architecture. BERT was originally pre-trained on BooksCorpus containing 800M words and English Wikipedia containing 2,500 million words. This pretraining over large data sets enables BERT to get familiar with language vocabulary. Further fine-tuning the pre-trained model for specific tasks refers to Transfer Learning. There are several BERT variants based on architecture such as the number of input layers, hidden layers, self-attention heads, and parameters used. While BERT is a powerful framework for NLP tasks, tweaking it can substantially improve its performance. Liu et al. [8] proposed RoBERTa which is a robust and optimized variant of BERT. They proposed several design changes such as removing the next sequence prediction objective, changing the masking pattern based on the data itself. They show that these changes along with pre-training the model for a longer duration and in larger batches results in substantial improvement and give state-of-the-art results on benchmark data sets such as GLUE, SQuAD, and RACE datasets. \n\nIII. METHODOLOGY \n\nThis section presents our proposed approach towards the classification of issue reports on GitHub. Our approach consists of the following phases: (1) Data Collection phase, which involves data collection from GitHub (2) Data Pre-processing phase, which involves data transformation and cleaning tasks. (3) Model Construction phase, which involves training a multilabel transformer-based model i.e. RoBERTa. (3) Automatic Issue Classifier (AIC), a GitHub application which can be leveraged to classify GitHub issues-reports on any GitHub repository. Figure 1 shows the overview of our approach. We briefly highlight the different phases of our approach in this section and explain details of each phase in the subsequent subsections. \n\nA. Data Collection \n\nFor this work, we used GitHub as our data source. First, we identified the top 55 candidate popular languages using the IEEE Spectrum Top Programming Languages list [15]. Further, we fetched the top 200 popular repositories across each programming language. Each repository on GitHub has an associated star count, which represents the popularity of the repository [16]. Here, we identified the project by their primary language. The primary language of the project is defined as the one in which the largest number of source code files are written [17]. Lastly, we fetched issues associated with each repository along with the related attributes. These attributes include, but are not limited to; title, body, and labels of issues. \n\nOur data set contains issues from numerous open-source and industrial projects such as Laravel, Kubernetes, Linux, Spark. Table I shows the top three projects from our data across some of the programming languages. In total, we were able to fetch 1,166,107 issues out of which 509,090 of the issues were unlabelled and 657,017 issues were labeled. The substantial amount of unlabelled issues provides us the opportunity to further dig down to this problem and provide an effective approach to categorize the issue reports. We used GitHub Search and Data API 6 to fetch this dataset. The complete dataset is available for public use 7. \n\nB. Data Pre-processing and Transformation \n\nTransformation and Filtering : We extracted the title and body of the issue and concatenated them together. We filtered our GitHub issue reports into three categories i.e. bug-report, enhancement, and question consistent with the prior work by Kallis et al. [2]. Here, each label is non-exclusive such that an issue can belong to more than one category. For instance, an issue can be labeled as a bug report and enhancement at the same time. Table II shows one such issue example. \n\nThe labels under consideration in our research are the default GitHub labels: \n\n1) Bug-report: Issue that reports a bug or fault in the project.   \n2) Enhancement: Issue that requests the enhancement of the project, such as performance improvement, feature request.   \n3Question: Issue that asks the question from the repository owner or maintainer. \n\nWe further filtered out the issues that were not in the English language and only used issues that are written in English. We used langdetect 8 to tag every issue with the language used in the text and found that 647,438 of the labeled issues were written in English while only 9,579 issues were written in other languages. \n\nPre-processing: We did not perform traditional NLP preprocessing steps such as stop-word removal, stemming, and lemmatization. The RoBERTa has its own tokenizer that does not require traditional NLP pre-processing steps to be applied to the text. However, we converted the text of all issue reports to lower case, as we are using RoBERTa with its base pretrained model which is a case-sensitive model. Additionally, as our data set contains real-world issue reports, our data set has a class-imbalance problem. Less than $4 \\%$ issues were labeled as questions. To resolve, the class imbalance problem, we randomly over-sampled the issue reports with less representative labels i.e. question label. \n\nC. Model Construction \n\nPre-trained transformer-based models are trained on a large natural language corpus, which empowers them to extract the detailed contextual word representation from the text. We used one such transformer-based model called RoBERTa [8], a robust and optimized variant of BERT [9]. The reason behind choosing RoBERTa over BERT is its state-of-the-art results on benchmark data sets such as GLUE, RACE, and SQuAD with over $2 \\%$ improvement over BERT. RoBERTa has several configurations which can be tuned on the basis of the pretraining approach. We use 'roberta-base' which consists of 12 transform layers, 768 hidden layers, and 12 self-attention heads. We used simpletransformers 9 to fine-tune our model. The package uses HuggingFace's 10 implementation of the model. \n\nModel Training: As we are using a pre-trained model, which essentially requires less number of training examples to be fine-tuned as compared to model trained from scratch, we randomly sampled 55,000 (approx) issue reports. We then divided the issue data set into $80 \\% - 2 0 \\%$ train-test split and fed the training data set to fine-tune our model. We trained our model for 5 epochs with a learning rate of 4e-05, a maximum sequence length of 128, and a batch size of 8. We trained our model using Google Colab 11. With 12 GB RAM, Tesla T4 14 GB GPU, and 2 Intel Xeon CPUs $\\textcircled { a } \\ 2 . 2 \\mathrm { G H z }$ it took an hour to train the model. \n\nD. Automatic Issue Classifier \n\nWe deployed our model using a GitHub application called Automatic Issue Classifier (AIC). Figure 2 explains the working flow of the application. AIC application can be integrated into any GitHub repository and can automatically assign the newly created issue report with its respective label. AIC is a Flask 12 web framework based application with a python runtime and is deployed on a WSGI server 13. AIC application can be integrated with any existing GitHub repository by accessing it through the application page 14. After landing on the application page, click on the 'Install' button and select the GitHub repository you want to associate it with. \n\nIV. EVALuatION \n\nIn this section, we evaluate our proposed approach using GitHub issue reports data set and answer the research questions presented earlier in section I. Following metrics are used to evaluate the proposed approach:. \n\nPrecision is the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false positives. A precision value closer to 1 is the most desirable. Recall is a measure of how well we were able to identify relevant instances. It is defined as the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false positives. A recall value of 1 indicates the best performance. F1-Score is defined as the harmonic mean of precision and recall. F-1 score closer to 1 is the most preferable. • Hamming Loss is a commonly reported metric for multi-label classification. It is the fraction of incorrectly predicted labeled out of the total number of labels. A hamming loss value of 0 indicates the best results. \n\nRQ1: Does the transformer-based approach perform better than the traditional keyword-based approach at classifying GitHub issue reports? \n\nTable III shows the results of our approach over GitHub issue reports classification. Our RoBERTa based approach is able to predict results for bugs, enhancement, and questions category with a hamming loss of 0.17, 0.16, and 0.16 respectively. Similarly, we were able to achieve an F1 score of $81 \\%$ , $74 \\%$ , and $80 \\%$ for bugs, enhancement, and questions category respectively which are comparable to results of existing studies. For instance, Kallis et al. [2] reported F1 scores of $8 3 . 1 \\%$ , $8 2 . 3 \\%$ , $8 2 . 5 \\%$ for bugs, enhancement, and questions category respectively. It is observed that our results are slightly degraded than the results achieved by Kallis et al. [2]. This is expected because our framework proposes a multi-label approach as opposed to the multi-class approach. Moreover, they sampled data in a class if any assigned label contains the text 'question', 'bug' or 'enhancement' however label text can be 'not-a-bug' which in this case would also be incorrectly sampled as a bug report, our sampling, in contrast, is based on exactly matching these labels resulting in more accurate classification. \n\nRQ2: Does the transformer-based model have the ability to be incorporated into an industry-level tool? \n\nWe successfully adopted and deployed the transformerbased model in an industry tool called Automatic Issue Classifier (AIC). Figure 3 shows a demonstration of AIC automatically assigning a label to an issue report. When a user creates an issue, AIC automatically assigns it a label based on the context. We deployed the tool as a GitHub application to ensure easy integration with industry projects. To enable users to tailor the application according to specific requirements, the complete source code of our application is available via a GitHub repository15. \n\nV. ReLEvaNce tO tHe Industry \n\nEffective classification of issue reports can have an immediate effect on software development processes. First, it can enable easy tracking of issue reports on GitHub, which could result in effective software maintenance. Secondly, the volume of each categorized issue report can help the project manager to review the project maintenance process at any point and make appropriate decisions. For instance, a large number of bug reports might indicate that the quality assurance process might need some help. Thirdly, having accurately categorized issue reports would help in routing the issue to the right software developer, who is working on the specific module/component. Also, accurately categorized issue reports can help the team leader to prioritize the tasks, and the release manager can figure out the way to stabilize the project. Lastly, the projects will be managed more efficiently and effectively, and ultimately would result in better products and projects. \n\nVI. THREATS TO VALIDITy \n\nThis section highlights some threats in validating our work. \n\n•Popularity Bias: We are fetching results from the top repositories of the popular programming languages, so our results might be influenced by the popularity bias. • Language Imbalance Bias: Our data set implies that some languages on GitHub are more popular than the rest. For instance, our data set contains a significant portion of the issues-reports that are associated with C# repositories. \n\nVII. FUTURE WORK \n\nOur future work would revolve around improving our industry tool: \n\n• Automatically Assigning Issues We plan to extend our tool by making it capable of not only assigning labels but also assigning them to a developer. More Categories: We also plan to add more categories such as 'documentation', 'wontfix', and 'help wanted', 'duplicate' in the issue data set, and analyze if our model can also categorize them with similar accuracy. \n\nVIII. CONCLUSION \n\nWe proposed a transformer-based approach towards the classification of GitHub issues and assigning them respective labels. Our model is able to well understand the context, hence provides accurate and efficient issue report classification. Our framework takes into account the non-exclusiveness of the issue-reports data and is capable of assigning multiple labels to issue reports at the same time. We extracted our data-set from GitHub repositories across the top 55 popular programming languages to ensure that our results and model are capable of generalizing across multiple languages. We evaluated our results over a data set containing three labels i.e., bugs, enhancement, and questions, and were able to achieve an F1 score of $81 \\%$ , $74 \\%$ , and $80 \\%$ respectively, which is comparable to existing issue classification results. We leveraged our state-of-the-art approach to develop an industry tool i.e. Automatic Issue Classifier that is capable of automatically labelling the issue reports. We believe that our tool will benefit the software engineering industry by enabling the teams to keep their focus on the necessary tasks by automating the manual task of labelling the issue reports. \n\nThis work was supported by North Dakota State University College of Engineering. We would also like to thank Giorgos Karantonis16 for sharing his key insights regarding the research problem. \n\nREFERENCES \n\n[1] S. E. S.

Both engines introduced changes and design improvements that will be covered in the Engine and Engine Management chapters. \n\nE46/4 Dimensions \n\nE46/2 Coupe \n\nThe E46/2 Coupe was introduced as a 2000 model year vehicle in both 323Ci and 328C variants. \n\nThe body of the E46 /2 Coupe is not a modified sedan, but is a completely distinct body. There are no sheet metal parts shared between the Sedan and the Coupe Only the design technology of the E46/4 was used to create the E46 Coupe. The Coupe is even longer and wider than the sedan. \n\nThe E46 Coupes have been given the \"Ci\" (coupe injected) trunk badge designation. This is a departure from the \"is\" (injected sport) from previous 3 series coupes. \n\nSince start of production,two engine variants have been offered, the M52TU and the M54 six cylinders. Both engines introduced changes and design improvements that will be covered in the Engine and Engine Management chapters. \n\nE46/2 Dimensions \n\nBody \n\nBody Shell \n\nThe structural rigidity of the E46 body shell was increased using computer aided design (CAD) techniques. Every component of the new body structure was designed using this method. CAD allows the design to be translated into computer aided manufacturing (CAM) more efficiently. To reduce the weight of the vehicle, while retaining strength, high strength steels are used and now amount to $50 \\%$ of the body shell weight. \n\nThe second area of focus of the body shell is \"structural dynamics\". This deals with vibration frequencies that effect the ride quality and rigid feel. The E46 body shell was designed so that the frequencies for torsional twisting and bending are separated and are in an inaudible range. The ranges match the E39 for twisting at 29 hertz and bending at 26 hertz. \n\nThe E46 continues with BMW's safety cage concept for passenger protection. The tubular impact structures continue to provide protection against body damage during front or rear impacts. \n\nThe E46 is 1.8 times more able to absorb energy in a 40mph offset frontal crash than the E36. \n\nHood and Headlights \n\nThe E46 follows the E38/E39 design with the kidney grille being integrated into the hood. The grille openings are more rounded and sweep down to the front bumper. The cowl opening is now integrated in the hood and is similar to the E38. The hood can be opened to a maximum of $9 0 ^ { \\circ }$ , the workshop position, by disconnecting the gas struts and inserting a pin in the aligned holes. \n\nThe hood is opened by first pulling the release lever located inside the vehicle and then releasing the secondary catch that pops out of the grille. \n\nThe E46 carries on with the traditional four head lamp configuration, however, no internal lens is used over each lamp. The free-form reflectors are clearly visible through the smooth, plastic covers. The plastic covers are lighter in weight and more resistant to breakage than the previous glass covers. \n\nVertical and horizontal adjustments for the head lamps are located on the upper rear edge of the assemblies. \n\nXenon low beam head lamps will be an available option starting with 9/98 production. \n\nXenon headlights are discussed in the E46 Driver Information Chapter. \n\nDoors \n\nThe doors on the E46 feature the door anchoring system introduced with the E38. The anchor consists of a horizontal bar in the door and a hook at the rear edge. The hook rests in a recess in the \"B\" and $\" \\textcircled { C } \"$ pillars and it reinforces the body in the event of a side impact. \n\nThe door seal design is copied from the E39 and is a single piece seal. \n\nDoor Anchoring System \n\nCross section of driver's door and \"B\" pillar in the normal closed position. \n\nUpon severe impact, the hook locks into the recessed notch to provide a unitized side impact protection system. \n\nAfter impact, the door springs back and unhooks the notch. \n\nThe door is clear of the \"B\" pillar and can be opened. \n\nDoor Handles \n\nThe door handles and locking system on the E46 are of a new design. The new bow type handles allow the doors to be opened easier. The locks are fuly encapsulated including the electrical components. The new door handle/latch/lock assembly offers improved reliability and security against theft. The micro-switches for door position and lock condition have been replaced by hall sensors. \n\nThere are no serviceable components on the lock assembly and it must be replaced as a unit. \n\nFrom September 2000 production, there was a modification done to the door handles of the E46. The modified door handles when pulled, fold upward instead of straight out as previous. The lock assembly was also modified to accommodate the new articulation of the door handles. \n\nSunroof \n\nThe sunroof design is similar to the E38/E39, however, the sunroof cassette is not serviceable and must be replaced as a complete unit. The sunroof is an option on the E46 and will come with a glass panel (moon roof) instead of a steel panel. \n\nInterior Features \n\nThe interior of the E46 has been completely redesigned with an emphasis on more space.   \nluxury and convenience without compromising the 3 series sporty characteristics. \n\nThe new instrument panel/dash is similar in design to the E39 with a slightly less pronounced orientation to the driver. The E38/E39 type face vent grills are used for air distribution. \n\nThe multi-function steering wheel is available on both the 323/325 models and standard on 328/330 models. There are two different steering wheels available, the four spoke wheel with MFL and a three spoke sport wheel with MFL. The three spoke sport wheel is optional for sedans and standard in coupes. The MFL includes the controls for the audio system on the left and the cruise control on the right. \n\nThe E46 comes equipped with a manually adjustable (ilt/telescopic) steering column. There is 30 mm of vertical and horizontal adjustment for the steering column. \n\n1. Spring Clamping mechanism 3. Steering lock with steering column tube \n\nDriver information Displays \n\nThe primary display for driver information is located in the instrument cluster. The coupe and sedan have different cluster lettering and faces. The secondary display in the console consists of the audio system and automatic climate control panel (if equipped with IHKA). \n\nTwo different radio types are available. One with the integrated tape player and the other radio incorporating a single in dash CD player. \n\nAccessory switches are located in the console below the heater control panel. These include the ASC switch and the heated seat switches. Later production vehicles (2000 M.Y.) utilize the SZM (Center Console Switching Center) in place of the separate switches. \n\nA new design (push to open/pull up to close) window switches are located in the center console on either side of the gear shift lever. The power window circuits include the one-touch and anti-trap features. \n\nInstrument Cluster electronics and audio systems are covered in the E46 Driver Information Chapter. \n\nSeats \n\nThe front seats are similar in design to the E36 seats with new internal construction to improve their support and comfort. Memory for the drivers seat position is available. The seat controls, including memory storage buttons are located on the side of the seat base. An optional lumbar support is also available for the E46. \n\nA split folding (40/60) seat is available as an option on sedans and standard on coupe models. \n\nThe release for the folding seat backs is located in the trunk on the let and right sides near the wheel arches. This increases the security aspect when keeping items locked in the trunk. \n\nPower Distribution \n\nThe battery is installed in the trunk of the E46 and features lead/calcium plate material for true maintenance free operation. The water usage of this battery is low throughout its service life. \n\nThe Battery Safety Terminal is installed at the positive terminal of the battery.A repair kit is available for the BST. \n\nThe E46 is produced with a vehicle specific wiring harness. This harness is based on the ordered optional equipment of the vehicle so that it contains the proper connectors and connections. Options can not be added at a later time without replacing the entire harness. \n\nSpecific kits are available to repair the harness in the event of an accident or damage to the harness. These repair kits include: \n\nEngine compartment Vehicle's rear area \n\nIf the entire harness need to be replaced, a new harness with the maximum equipment or options must be ordered. This is the only harness that will be stocked in the parts system. \n\nThere are three locations for fuses on the E46: \n\nThe fuse holder above the glove box The E-Box in the engine compartment In the trunk near the battery \n\nThe E46 uses high amperage fuses for circuit protection. The battery power supply is protected by a 250 amp fuse in the trunk. \n\nFront Suspension \n\nTsigle bal jont ru axlef the   ba nh desi. Deig ancp nent changes were developed to improve the ride quality and handling characteristics. The following changes are incorporated into the E46 front suspension system: \n\nA new forged aluminum control arm is used on the E46 (except all-wheel drive). It offers the advantages of weight reduction and lower unsprung mass. \n\nHydraulic bushings are used for the rear lower control arm support. \n\nHollow strut piston rods are used to reduce weight \n\nThe steering knuckles are press fit into the strut tubes which reduces the tolerances of the front suspension geometry. \n\nThe caster has been increased to improve straight line stability. \n\nThe track has been widened for improved cornering. \n\nAluminum brake dust shields are used for weight reduction \n\nAltogether there is 5.72 lbs less unsprung weight in the front suspension which enhances ride comfort and handling. \n\nFront Camber Adjustment \n\nThe top of the strut is mounted through elongated holes. The strut is fixed in position when the vehicle is assembled. If minor corrections need to be made to the front end alignment, the pin can be driven down and the strut can be moved in the slots to adjust the camber. Approximately $5 ^ { \\circ }$ of adjustment is available by moving the strut in the slots. \n\nFollow the instructions for making the Camber adjustment described in Repair Manual 32 00 610. \n\nUse Special Tool 32 3 140 to make the adjustment. \n\nRear Suspension \n\nThe design of the E46 rear suspension is based on the E36 \"C\" arm type. However, all components of the suspension are new and designed to suit the E46 for: \n\nComfort and convenience Handling and stability Noise reduction \n\nThe sub frame is a new design employing steel tubes and metal sections. It is more rigid than the previous sub frame. This provides a stable platform for the rear suspension to work from. The differential is mounted to the sub frame using a hydraulic mount. The sub frame is mounted to the body at four vibration absorbing rubber mounts. \n\nThe upper transverse control arms are made from cast aluminum for weight saving. \n\nFinal Drive \n\nThe final drive is the compact (HAG 188K) type that is lighter in weight than the type used on the E36. Features of the compact final drive assembly include: \n\nCompact housing   \nShorter pinion shaft   \nHollow drive flange shafts   \nNo side bearing covers   \nElimination of speedometer gear   \nLifetime synthetic oil \n\nLimited slip differential is no longer possible with the compact differential. \n\nThe drive shaft and differential are now mounted on the center line of the vehicle. This enables the transmission tunnel to be narrower increasing the interior passenger space. With this change, the axle shafts are now different in length and are no longer interchangeable. \n\nBrake System \n\nThe braking system is upgraded for the E46 to match the vehicle's size and braking requirements. The dual circuit (front/back) distribution system continues to be used for optimized braking response and performance. Refinements to the brake pedal linkage increase the brake response time to improve braking performance. \n\nSingle piston floating calipers with vented rotors are used on the front and rear brakes. \n\nThe E46 uses a $1 0 \"$ vacuum booster, vented in the engine compartment to reduce noise in the passenger compartment. \n\nE46 SPORT WAGON \n\nModel: E46/3 \n\nProduction: 1/00 \n\nObjectives: \n\nAfter completing this module you should be able to: \n\nIdentify the changes to the body of the E46 for the Sport Wagon. \n\nList the changes to the interior of the E46 Sport Wagon. \n\nDiscuss the operation of the rear tailgate/window system. \n\nThe E46/3 \"Sport Wagon\" is being introduced to the US market as a 2001 Model Year vehicle. It joins the highly successful Sedan and Coupe models to further enhance the product line up and offer 3 series customers an alternative choice of vehicle. \n\nUp to the \"B\" pilars, the Sport wagon is identical to the E46 sedan. The rear doors have been remodeled for wagon usage and the tail gate is similar to the E39 Sport Wagon with an opening rear window. \n\nThe rear seats fold down to provide 1345 liters of cargo space. With the seats up, the rear compartment provides 435 liters of load space. \n\nBODY SPECIFICATIONS \n\nThe E46 Sport Wagon is 7 mm longer that the sedan and the unloaded height is 6 mm lower. The wheel base, width and turning radius are the same as the E46 sedan. The following are the maximum cargo capacity/ loads: \n\n435 Liters luggage capacity - with rear seat back up   \n1345 Liters luggage capacity - with back rest down   \n540KG in the rear   \n75 KG on the roof. \n\nBody \n\nFrom the front bumper up to the \"B\" pillar the E46 Sport Wagon body is identical to the sedan. From the \"B\" pillar rearward, the body shell of the Sport Wagon is all new and includes: \n\nNew Rear doors   \nNew Tailgate and hinge mechanism   \nNew Frameless rear window   \nNew Rear Bumper   \nNo tail gate lock cylinder   \nRoof rails as optional equipment \n\nThe structural rigidity and \"structural dynamic\" characteristics introduced with the E46 sedan are carried over to the E46 Sport wagon. As with the sedan and coupe, the Sport Wagon body shell acts as the passenger's safety cage along with the tubular impact structures for the front and rear bumper mountings. \n\nInterior \n\nUp to the \"B\" pillar, the interior equipment and trim level corresponds to the E46 sedan. The front seat options are the same as the E46 Sedan, while the rear seating area has been newly designed to provide an attractive package that offers optimum functionality and useable space when the seats are folded down for cargo loading. \n\nThe rear seats backs are a 60/40 split with the center arm rest section on the left seat back. The center passenger's inertia reel is mounted to the left seat back, while the left/right rear passenger's belt reels are mounted on the wheel housings. The lower section of the seat back is separate foam piece that enables the back rest pivot point to be higher on the seat back. This allows the back rest to fold flat for more useable cargo loading space. \n\nCenter Arm Rest \n\nThe center arm rest incorporates the non-adjustable center head rest. The center arm rest is folded down to gain access to the storage compartment and cup holders , which are integrated into the rear of the head rest. \n\nChild Seat Anchor \n\nThere are three child seat hold down anchors positioned behind the rear seat back rest. The plastic covers must be removed to access the hold down anchors, \n\nI . \n\nCargo area \n\nThe cargo area offers 435 liters of cargo space with the rear seat back rest raised and 1345 liters with it lowered. The cargo area offers a spring loaded - roller blind and cargo net similar to the E39 Sport Wagon. \n\nStorage Compartments \n\nStorage areas on the left and right in the rear are used to house the rear window washer fluid reservoir on the right and various sound system components on the left. \n\nLoad Floor/Spare \n\nThe load floor is removable to access the spare tire and control module mounting area located beneath. A strap is provided to hold the load floor up while accessing the storage area. The interior trim panel must also be removed for access to the spare and control modules. \n\nPower Socket \n\nA 12 Volt power socket is installed on the left side of the cargo area behind the rear seat back. \n\nTail gate \n\nThe tail gate is similar in design to the E39 Sport Wagon, including the rear glass that is hinged separately and can be opened independently from the tail gate. \n\nRear Actuator \n\nThe actuator for the tailgate release is mounted on the rear apron behind the trim panel. Control of the actuator is a function of the GM - ZKE system. \n\nEmergency Release \n\nThe tailgate does not feature a lock cylinder so an emergency release mechanism is incorporated into the tail gate latch. It allows mechanical opening of the gate actuator in the event of an electrical failure. The release is located along the lower edge of the rear apron behind a small access cover. After removing the cover, the lever is pushed to the right to mechanically release the tail gate. \n\nThe rear apron of the E46 Sport Wagon is lowered for easier loading/unloading. A plastic rubbing strip prevents the bumper from being scratched when cargo is being loaded/unloaded. \n\nRear Window \n\nThe Frameless rear window is bonded to a metal carrier which is hinged to the body. If the rear window needs replacement, it is supplied with the glass bonded to the metal carrier. \n\nThe release switch for opening the rear glass is incorporates into the rear wiper arm cover under the triangle trim plate. \n\nRear Glass Hinge \n\nThe hinges are a new design (torsional coil spring) that are compact in shape for space saving reasons. \n\nThe rear window is adjusted through the slotted mounted bolts. The gap of the window should be uniform on all sides. The height of the rear window is adjusted using shims on the hinge mounts. Refer to the repair manual for complete adjustment procedures and sequence. \n\nRear Washer Nozzle \n\nThe rear window washer spray nozzle, as well as the third brake light, is mounted at the top left side integrated into the spoiler. \n\nE46 Convertible \n\nModel: E46/2C \n\nProduction: 01/00 \n\nObjectives: \n\nAfter completing this module, you should be able to: \n\nDescribe how the body shl is reinforced to improve Torsional Rigidity   \nIdentify the floor pan reinforcements for energy absorption on the SGS seats. Identify the body shell reinforcements necessary for the addition of the Variable Convertible Top Storage Compartment Floor. Describe how the windshield frame is reinforced.   \nIdentify and describe the functions of the Tension Strut.   \nIdentify and describe the function of the Aluminum plate. \n\nIntroduction \n\nThe E46 Convertible is the replacement for the E36 Convertible and is based on the E46 Coupe. It is initially being introduced in March 2000, as a 323 Model only with the M52 TU 2.5 liter engine. The 3 liter version of the E46iC will begin production starting in 6/2000. \n\nThe E46 323 features a new design top that consists of a three layer top and all glass rear window. The 323 comes with a manual top as standard equipment. The new fully automatic electro-hydraulic top is available as an option. The 330 E46iC will come with the fully automatic top as standard equipment. \n\nThe roll over protection system is standard equipment and is similar in design to the E36 system. The roll over protection bars are hidden by the rear headrest and deployed under the same criteria as the E36 system. \n\nThe front seats of the E46iC are a new design with the seat integrated belt (SGS) systen similar to the system introduced on the E31 - 8 series vehicles. \n\nBody Shell \n\nThe body shell of the E46iC has been developed specifically for the convertible to improve crash performance which is similar to the E46 Coupe. This was achieved by the use of reinforcements on the body shell that improved torsional rigidity (body twisting). In the main body floor pan, reinforcements were necessary to accommodate the new SGs (Seat Integrated Belt System) seat system. In the rear floor pan, reinforcements were necessary to account for the variable convertible top storage. compartment floor. \n\nComponents \n\nFloor Pan \n\nThe floor pan is reinforced to support the SGS seat by heavier cross brace members, reinforced tunnel/floor pan and reinforced engine support brackets. During a collision all forces occurring on the seat are channeled to be absorbed by the floor pan. \n\nWindshield Frame \n\nThe windshield frame is reinforced with stepped reinforcing tubes to allow it to act as a roll-over protection. During the rollover all of the forces exerted on the A-pillar of the windshield frame are transmitted as a Moment (Torque) to the bottom of the Apillar where stepped reinforced tubes are reinforced. \n\nRear Bulkheads \n\nThe rear bulkheads are redesigned to support the rollover protection and seat belts. They are welded to increase structural rigidity and to secure rear seat, rear seat belts and the mounting point for the ISO child seat. \n\nVariable Top Storage Compartment \n\nThe variable top storage compartment is reinforced to make the top storage compartment rigid and stronger, not to allow twisting moments when the soft top is in its compartment or when the compartment is opened to enlarge the storage area. \n\nTension Strut \n\nAluminum Support Plate \n\nAn aluminum support plate is incorporated into the front suspension carrier to achieve a high degree of rigidity combined with low weight. \n\nAll of these design improvements increased the E46iC torsional rigidity by $50 \\%$ compared to the E36iC: \n\nTension struts are integrated into the rear of the body shell to improve the torsional rigidity by not allowing body twist in the rear. It also keeps the rear end of the car intact with the middle floor pan. \n\nE36 Convertible Torsional Rigidity 6000Nm/degree E46 Convertible Torsional Rigidity 9000 Nm/degree \n\nREAR SEATS \n\nThe E46iC is designed as a four passenger vehicle. Only two seat belts are installed in the rear that correspond to the seat belt system of the E36iC. \n\nThe E46iC is equipped with child seat mounting brackets on the left and right sides below the seat base. The brackets conform to ISO (International Organization of Standardization) for placement on the rear floor pan. Any ISO child seat can be installed by simply sliding the seat into position between the seat base and backrest and locking it into place. \n\nVARIABLE CONVERTIBLE TOP STORAGE COMPARTMENT FLOOR \n\nPurpose of the System: \n\nThe trunk of the E46 convertible offers a new feature called the \"Variable Convertible Top Storage Compartment Floor\". This feature allows the luggage storage area to be enlarged by approximately 40 liters when the soft top is raised or removed for hard top installation. \n\nComponents of the system: \n\nVariable Compartment Floor \n\nThe variable compartment floor is constructed of plastic with fabric covering. It is hinged mechanically so that it can be rotated up into the top storage area providing additional luggage storage space in the trunk. The floor is hinged at four points to allow it to articulate and fold upwards: \n\nActuating Lever \n\nAn actuating lever is integrated in the variable compartment floor on the right side. It allows the compartment floor to be opened and closed using the actuating lever. It also locks the compartment floor into position. \n\nDampening Piston \n\nA dampening piston is also integrated in the variable compartment floor on the right side. It assists in the movement of the variable compartment floor to either position and keep it fixed in that set position (retracted or extended). The lower dampening piston hinge switches the micro switch integrated on the right side of the compartment floor when the variable compartment floor is in the raised position. This signal is provided to the CVM to lock out the operation of the convertible-top. \n\nMICRO-SWITCH \n\nSystem Operation: \n\nOpening the variable compartment floor \n\nThe convertible top must be raised or removed from the storage compartment.   \nPull the actuating lever rear wards and push it down and toward the rear bulkhead. \n\nClosing the variable compartment floor \n\nPull the actuating lever down.   \nPull the compartment floor rear wards to close the floor. \n\nE46 ALL-WHEEL DRIVE SYSTEM \n\nModel: E46/16 (330xi/A, 325xi/A, 325xi/A Sport Wagon). \n\nProduction date: 330xi 8/00, 325xi 9/00. \n\nObjectives \n\nAfter completing this module you should be able to: \n\nIdentify the changes made to the E46 to accommodate all-wheel drive. \n\nUnderstand the construction of the NV124 transfer case. \n\nIntroduction \n\nThe E46/16 introduces the return of the BMW all-wheel drive car to the United States. This t ll-heel drive wil be option (SA 03), available on 6 sdans and Sport Wagos beginning 2001M.Y. \n\nVehicles with the all-wheel drive option have been given the engineering designation of E46/16. \n\nOne of the significant changes from the previous E30 ix is that the E46/16 does not use a viscous coupling or limited slip differential. The all-wheel drive system has largely been taken from the X5 concept. It uses two open differentials and a single speed transfer case. Power distribution is $3 8 \\%$ to the front and $62 \\%$ to the rear, giving the E46/16 the feel of a genuine rear-drive road car. \n\nWith it's additional 17mm ground clearance, the xi is particularly suited to stretches of snow and ice covered roads and its sure footedness is made possible by the use of the Bosch DSC III 5.7 system, first used on the X5. \n\nPerformance of the all-wheel drive E46 does not suffer either, this is because of a lightweight all-wheel drive system that only adds 100kg (220lbs).Weight distribution is largely unaffected at $5 2 . 7 \\%$ front and $4 7 . 3 \\%$ rear (2wd: 51. $0 \\%$ front, $4 9 . 0 \\%$ rear). \n\nChanges from the standard drive version are: \n\nA specially designed body pan with a widened transmission tunnel and modifications on the driver's side to accept the transfer case. \n\nModified oil pan and engine mounts to provide access for the front axles. \n\nA completely new front engine carrier. \n\nRe-reinforcements for the front strut bearings. \n\nA compact new transfer case (NV 124). \n\nNew transmission cross-member. \n\nBosch DSC III 5.7 \n\nChassis \n\nFront Axle \n\nThe front axle has been completely re-designed over the standard drive E46. All components are constructed of steel. \n\nThe front axle carrier consists of two square frame sections welded to two tubes to form a box structure. The axle carrier is bolted to the vehicle frame at both the front and rear attachment points. \n\nThe steel lower control arms, which are smaller than the aluminum arms used on the 2wd model attach at the rear to the axle carrier. \n\nThe pivot at the apex of the lower control arms are a separate ball joint bolted to the axle carrier. \n\nThe purpose of the re-design of the lower control arms and mounting points is to provide clearance for the front axle shafts. \n\nThe hydraulic engine mounts are different from the 2wd version and have also been relocated to provide front axle clearance. \n\nThe front sway bar has been increased in diameter to 23.5mm (2wd standard: 23mm, sports suspension: $2 4 \\mathsf { m m }$ to accommodate the additional weight. A sports suspension option is not available for the xi. \n\nThe struts are shorter than the 2wd and there are reinforcement plates between the strut bearing and the sheet metal of the strut towers to prevent deformation when traveling on very poor road surfaces. \n\nThe spring travel of the E46/16 is approximately 20mm less than the 2wd version. \n\nThe shorter front axle spring travel is due to the limited angle of deflection of the front axle shafts. \n\nSteering \n\nThe rack and pinion steering unit has been modified from the 2wd. It is constructed with a larger diameter piston. \n\nThis is necessary to counter the additional drag of the all-wheel drive system and the wider standard wheels and tires. \n\nThe lower steering spindle is different than the 2wd and connects to the steering rack via a double cardan joint. \n\nTurning radius of the E46/16 is 35.8ft, 1.4ft greater than the 2wd. \n\nDifferential and Front Axles \n\nThe differential for the front axle is bolted to left side of the engine oil pan. The differential \n\nis driven by a 40mm single piece drive shaft. The drive shaft has universal joints at both ends. \n\nType: VAG 174   \nAxle ratios: 330xi 325xi Auto: 3,46:1 3,46:1 Man: 3,07:1 3,23:1   \nMax torque: 2000Nm   \nWeight: 40 lbs \n\nLifetime fluid fill: SAF-XO \n\nThe oil sump has been modified to accommodate the right side axle. A connecting tube is welded into the oil pan. A shaft runs inside of the connecting tube between the front differential and the axle shaft on the right side. \n\nThe steering knuckle is modified to accept the CV joint of the front axles. The front wheel bearings are unique to the E46/16 and incorporate the wheel speed sensor pulse wheel into the bearing seal. \n\nTwo drive shafts of equal length are used to transmit power to the front wheels. \n\nRear Axle \n\nThe complete rear axle and the rear differential are the same as the 2wd version of the 325i and 230i \n\nType: HAG 188N   \nAxle ratios: 330xi 325xi Auto: 3,46:1 3,46:1 Man: 3,07:1 3,23:1   \nMax torque: 3000Nm   \nWeight: 84 lbs \n\nLifetime fluid fill: SAF-XO \n\nThe rear spring/strut travel of the E46/16 is approximately 17mm less than the 2wd version. The reason for the reduced travel in the rear is to oppose any excessive body roll as a result of the higher body profile. \n\nThe rear sway bar has been increased in diameter to 20mm (2wd standard: 18mm, sports suspension: 19mm) to accommodate the additional weight. \n\nTires and wheels \n\nStandard wheel size is $1 7 \\times 7 . 0$ to ensure there is enough room for the front axles and brakes. Tire size is 205/50 R17 All-season radials \n\nTransmissions \n\nThere are two transmission variants for the 325xi and 330xi. \n\nThe manual transmission for both versions is the S5D-280Z direct gear transmission. The extension housing is modified to accept the transfer case. \n\nThe transmission has a lifetime fill of MTF-LT1 synthetic transmission fluid. \n\nThe automatic transmission for both the 330xi and $3 2 5 \\times \\mathrm { i }$ is the A5S-390 R (General Motors) transmission with GS 20 AGS control and Steptronic shifter. \n\nThe transmission has a lifetime fill of Texaco 8072B. \n\nTransmission Cross-member \n\nAlong with the lower transfer case section, the cast aluminum transmission cross-member is a low profile design to optomize ground clearance. \n\nBoth manual and automatic transmissions utilize the same part. \n\nTransfer Case \n\nThe Transfer case for the E46/16 is the NV 124 manufactured by New Venture. The primary difference between the NV 124 and the NV 125 used in the X5 SAV is that it uses gears instead of a drive chain for torque transfer to the front axle. \n\nThe reason gears are used is to produce a compact low profile transfer case that could fit in the transmission tunnel of an E46 without excessively limiting the forward travel of the drivers seat. \n\nManufacturer: New Venture Type: NV 124 Torque Distribution: $3 8 \\%$ : $62 \\%$ Maximum Torque: 300Nm \n\nThe transfer case is only one speed and does not use any viscous coupler. \n\nThe transmission ratio of the planetary gear set provides a fixed torque transfer of 38:62 (front:Rear). The output speeds to the front and rear axle are the same (1:1). \n\nThe input to the Planetary Carrier is from the output shaft of the transmission. \n\nThe Sun Gear of the Planetary assembly is turned by the Planetary Gears, the Sungear then provides torque to the Transfer Gear. \n\nOutput Gear Front Axle. \n\nThe Transfer Gear drives the Fr Output via gear-to-gear contact. The front axle is driven via a flange connected to the output gear. \n\nFrom the Ring Gear , the power is transmitted via the driveshaft to the rear axle differential. \n\nThe transfer case is filled with a lifetime fill of MTF-LT1 P/N 83-22-9-408-942. The only repairs possible are the replacement of the three oil seals and the hydraulic mount. \n\nOil Volume: 0.24 liter Drain/Fill plug torque: 33Nm \n\nReview Questions \n\nHow is the hood of an E46 placed into the workshop position? \n\n2Explain the door anchoring system of the E46. \n\nDescribe the fuse locations of the E46. \n\n4Describe the changes made to the E46 front and rear suspension from the previous 3 series (E36). \n\nWhere is the emergency release for the tailgate located on the E46 Sport Wagon? \n\nWhat allows the windshield frame of the E46 Convertible to act as a rolover protection device? \n\n7.How is the floor pan on the E46 Convertible improved for structural rigidity? \n\n8Describe the components used in the E46 all-wheel drive running gear. \n\n9.Describe the changes made to the front suspension of the E46 to accommodate the all-wheel drive system.",

This service includes: \n\n$\\triangleright$ The BMW Maintenance Program: No cost factory-recommended maintenance for 4 years/50,000 miles from the original in-service date, whichever comes first. \n\n$\\triangleright$ BMW Roadside Assistance: No-cost 24/7 on-the-road assistance for 4 years/unlimited miles from the original in-service date. Also includes trip-interruption benefits as well as trip routing services. \n\n$\\triangleright$ New Vehicle Limited Warranty: Limited coverage for defects in materials and workmanship for 4 years/50,000 miles from the original in-service date, whichever comes first. Repairs will only be made at authorized BMW centers using Original BMW Parts. \n\nThe BMW Maintenance Program \n\nThe BMW Maintenance Program is a benefit designed to help reduce the cost of ownership. This program has been devised with the following objectives: to maximize vehicle safety, reliability, and resale value by minimizing breakdowns resulting from wear, and minimizing cost and inconvenience by computing maintenance intervals based upon the specific manner in which each individual vehicle is driven. \n\nA 2014 X1 vehicle purchased from an authorized BMW center in the United States (including Puerto Rico) is covered by the BMW Maintenance Program for 48 months or 50,000 miles, whichever occurs first. Coverage begins on the date of first retail sale or the date the vehicle is first placed into service as a sales demonstrator, Aftersales Mobility Program (AMP) Vehicle or BMiW Group company vehicle, whichever is earlier. \n\nAny authorized BMW center in the United States (including Puerto Rico) will perform the scheduled and/or additional maintenance services on your vehicle at no expense to you so long as your vehicle qualifies for coverage under the BMW Maintenance Program. \n\nCoverage \n\nThe BMW Maintenance Program covers all factory recommended maintenance, as determined by the Condition Based Service (CBS) system. Additional specific items that need replacement due to normal wear and tear, and that are not covered by the original New Vehicle Limited Warranty - such as brake pads, brake rotors, and wiper blade inserts - are included, provided wear and tear exceeds BMW wear limits. Any applicable adjustments required due to normal operating conditions are also included. See pages 7-8 of this booklet for additional information. \n\nExclusions from coverage include the following: \n\n$\\triangleright$ Items reimbursable under your New Vehicle Limited Warranty   \n$\\triangleright$ Gasoline   \n$\\triangleright$ Gasoline additive   \n$\\triangleright$ Windshield washer additive (except when in conjunction with scheduled maintenance)   \n$\\triangleright$ Tires, wheel alignment, tire balance and rotation   \n$\\triangleright$ Parking brake shoes/linings   \n$\\triangleright$ Reset Tire Pressure Monitor   \n$\\triangleright$ Wear and tear of soft trim items, such as: seats, carpets, moldings, headliner, door panels and all chrome trim   \n$\\triangleright$ Damage, including consequential, which results from negligence, improper operation of the vehicle, wear and tear or deterioration due to driving habits or conditions, improper repair, environmental influences, flood, accident or fire damage, road salt corrosion, alteration, installation of non-genuine BMW accessories, or use of improper, poor quality or contaminated fuel   \n$\\triangleright$ Altered or unreadable Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) or odometer irregularities or vehicles where the true mileage cannot be determined   \n$\\triangleright$ Maintenance or repair after the vehicle is deemed a total loss   \n$\\triangleright$ Maintenance or repairs performed by other than an authorized BMW center within the United States (including Puerto Rico)   \n$\\triangleright$ \"Topping off\" low fluids (e.g., engine oil, antifreeze, washer fluid, etc.) except when done in conjunction with a scheduled maintenance or other required maintenance work (as outlined in the customized maintenance checklist printout) that is performed during an applicable Maintenance Program period   \n$\\triangleright$ Vehicles used in competitive events   \n$\\triangleright$ Oil changes performed outside the recommended maintenance intervals as indicated by the Condition Based Service \n\nMaintenance Upgrade Option \n\nPlease contact your authorized BMW center for information regarding the purchase of optional Maintenance Program Upgrades. Eligibility and coverage exclusions may apply. \n\nIntervals \n\nTime intervals should be followed using the maintenance intervals as indicated by the BMW Condition Based Service. \n\nMaintenance intervals on motor vehicles have conventionally been specified based upon accumulated mileage. However, driving conditions have a major influence on routine maintenance requirements; distance traveled is only one of the significant factors. A vehicle driven for 50,000 miles of short trips in the city with numerous cold starts, prolonged periods of idling, stop-and-go driving, and high engine speeds during acceleration requires more frequent maintenance intervals than a vehicle driven for 50,000 miles for long distances at low engine speeds primarily at operating temperature. \n\nThe advanced technologies at BMW have led to the development of the unique BMW Condition Based Service (CBS) system which computes the actual optimum maintenance requirements based not only upon the accumulated mileage, but taking into account important factors such as high or low engine speeds, short or long trip driving. \n\nCondition Based Service (CBS) \n\nCBS is a further development of the Service Interval Indicator System. \n\nThe remaining times for selected maintenance tasks as well as any legally prescribed dates are displayed to you individually: \n\n$\\triangleright$ Engine oil   \n$\\triangleright$ Brakes - front and rear separately   \n$\\triangleright$ Brake fluid   \n$\\triangleright$ Vehicle check   \n$\\triangleright$ Required State Inspection(s) \n\nCBS thus determines the current and future maintenance requirements. This data can also be read from the vehicle key by your BMW Service Advisor and used to propose the optimum scope of maintenance. \n\nDisconnecting the battery during periods of long-term storage will interrupt the calculation of time-based services. BMW recommends that you have all items requiring time-based maintenance, such as brake fluid and possibly also the engine oil and microfilter, brought up to date by your authorized BMW center. Also see the section on battery care on page 9 of this Booklet. \n\nService Required Display \n\nInfo Display screen contents \n\nThe distance remaining until your next service briefly appears when you switch on the ignition. \n\nThe Info Display immediately switches to its compute mode when you press one of the two buttons on the turn signal indicator lever. \n\nFor certain maintenance operations, you can view the respective distance remaining or due date individually in the instrument cluster or in the Control Display (with optional iDrive; see page 5). \n\nInfo Display screens in the instrument cluster \n\nPush button 1 on the turn indicator lever up or down repeatedly until the appropriate symbol appears in the display, accompanied by the words \"SERVICE-INFO\". \n\n2.

The Service Advisor at your authorized BMW center has a device called a key reader. When your Service Advisor inserts your key into the key reader, all pertinent vehicle and servicing data will be available, and a customized maintenance checklist is printed out based on the specific operations called for by the Condition Based Service. \n\nService requirement details C Date: 05/2016 § Vehicle inspection Next state inspection due soon \n\nTo exit from the menu: \n\nSelect the arrow and press the controller. \n\nSpecial Note  Maintenance Intervals \n\nThe maintenance requirements for your vehicle are determined dynamically by the Condition Based Service (CBS) system. The maintenance items stated herein reflect the latest information available at the time of the printing of this Booklet, and are subject to change. \n\n2014 X1 vehicles built prior to July 2013 utilized a different CBS \"connected service item\" interval as detailed on page 9. \n\nThe completion of certain subsequent maintenance items or services, as required to properly maintain your vehicle, will be specified at intervals computed by the BMW Condition Based Service system as follows: \n\n$\\triangleright$ Oil Service: Engine oil should be changed with the engine at operating temperature. \n\nAll 2014 model year X1 vehicles are factory-filled with BMW High Performance Synthetic oils. We recommend BMW High Performance 5W-30 Synthetic Oil (BMW part number 07 51 0 017 866) for regular scheduled engine oil changes. \n\nBMW recommends that you check your engine oil level whenever you add fuel to your vehicle. For information on checking your engine oil level, refer to your vehicle's Owner's Manual. \n\nIf you need to add oil between oil changes and BMW High Performance Synthetic Oil is unavailable, for the purpose of topping up the engine oil level only, BMW recommends use of one of the below-listed synthetic oils: \n\nThe synthetic oils listed below meet BMW's   \nLong-life rating LL01 (API rating SL):   \n$\\triangleright$ Castrol Syntec European Formula SAE OW-30   \n$\\triangleright$ Mobil 1 SAE 0W-40   \n$\\triangleright$ Pennzoil Platinum European Formula Ultra SAE 5W-30   \n$\\triangleright$ Valvoline SynPower SAE 5W-30 \n\nThe choice of the right SAE grade is based on the climatic conditions in the region in which you normally drive your BMW. To best determine which SAE grade is best suited for your vehicle, contact an authorized BMW center. \n\nIf you are unable to obtain a recommended synthetic oil from the list above, for the purpose of topping up the engine oil level only, use only a synthetic oil with an API rating of SM or higher. \n\nThe following maintenance services: - Brake Fluid Service; - Intake Air Cleaner Service; \n\n- Oxygen Sensor Service; - Spark Plug Service; - Ventilation Microfilter Service, must be performed when required as indicated by the following as applicable: \n\n$\\triangleright$ The specified CBS engine oil service counter interval   \n$\\triangleright$ The time interval (the first occurrence based on the vehicle's production date)   \n$\\triangleright$ The stated mileage for a \"non-connected\" maintenance service \n\nRefer to pages 7 - 9 for additional information. \n\nAdditionally, \n\n- The engine coolant has a long-term rating and does not need to be changed except for system repairs. \n\nThe automatic transmission installed in the BMWs covered in this publication contain transmission oil with a long-term rating. The oil does not need to be changed except for repairs. \n\nFor your convenience, you may also wish to have your authorized BMW center perform any necessary operations to fulfill any state inspection requirements in your area, concurrent with the maintenance services specified above during other repairs. Should you request more frequent maintenance service, the cost of these services will not be covered by the Maintenance Program. \n\nBMW has applied the most modern technological advances not only to the design and production of your vehicle, but also to computing of the optimum maintenance interval for your type of operations and driving style. Your authorized BMW center has made a substantial investment in unique BMW special service tools to enable BMW factory trained service technicians to perform quality repairs on your BMW in minimal time, to help maximize your satisfaction with your BMW, its longevity, and resale value. \n\nQuality Certification I \n\nQuality Certification I \n\nPerformed by (selling BMW center/Stamp with Code) \n\nFREE OF CHARGE \n\nDate Mileage \n\nAuthorized Signature of Service Manager \n\nFor a detailed list of items inspected, refer to the Quality Certification I form provided to the Owner at time of delivery. A copy of the form is on file at the selling authorized BMW center. \n\nFuel Quality - Gasoline \n\nOnly use fuels advertised to have adequate detergency and low alcohol (such as ethanol) content. Please refer to your owner's manual for important information on the fuel recommended for use in your vehicle. Use of fuels with insufficient detergent and/or excess alcohol can cause driveability problems that necessitate cleaning intake valves and fuel injection valves, and, when applicable, adjusting the engine idle. We suggest having this work performed by your authorized BMW center, perhaps while regular maintenance is performed. Your authorized BMW center can also recommend a gasoline additive that will provide sufficient detergency. This recommended unscheduled maintenance which may be necessitated by use of inappropriate fuels is not required in order to maintain the emission warranty. It also is not covered by your vehicle's warranty because no defect in material or workmanship or component failure is involved. \n\nMaintenance Service Summary \n\nThe Condition Based Service (CBS) system will determine the requirement for performing the maintenance services described in this section, ending on page 8. These services may be required either individually or in conjunction with other maintenance services. \n\nMaintenance services are performed as outlined in this section, based on intervals of either time, mileage or after performing a specified number of previous services. These intervals correspond to the latest information available when this Booklet was printed. Maintenance intervals are subject to change with newer vehicles or may also apply retroactively. Your authorized BMW center will be able to advise and perform maintenance services as required by the most recent information that applies to your vehicle. \n\nThe maintenance services \"connected to a specific CBS engine oil service,\" as outlined below, apply to vehicles built as of July 2013. \n\nX1 vehicles built prior to July 2013 utilized a different CBS \"connected service item\" interval as detailed on page 9. \n\nStandard operations \n\nMaintenance work: \n\n$\\triangleright$ Verify Check Control messages. \n\n$\\triangleright$ Check indicator and warning lights. \n\n$\\triangleright$ Reset CBS display. \n\n$\\triangleright$ Inspect tires, adjust tire pressures and reset Tire Pressure Monitor. \n\n$\\triangleright$ Check parking brake functionality while the vehicle is being driven into the workshop. \n\nEngine oil \n\nMaintenance work: \n\n$\\triangleright$ Change the engine oil and oil filter (as shown in CBS).

Insufficient use of the vehicle could result in short term starting problems and, in the long term, could damage the battery. \n\nIn case the vehicle is not operated for several weeks, it is advisable to: \n\n$\\triangleright$ consider using a proper trickle charger, following the charger manufacturer's instructions, to maintain the battery's state of charge; or $\\triangleright$ consult your authorized BMW center regarding battery removal. Once removed, the battery must be charged and stored in a cool, dry place where it can be protected from freezing. If the battery will be stored for over 3 months, it must be recharged every 3 months, or else it will become damaged and useless. \n\nPlease consult with your authorized BMW center for further guidance and information. \n\nCorrosion Protection \n\nExtensive corrosion protection measures implemented by BMW now make it possible to offer a 12-year unlimited mileage anti-corrosion warranty against rust perforation on your vehicle provided that the vehicle is properly maintained. Information on proper maintenance is available in this Booklet and your vehicle's Owner's Manual. \n\nThe major degree of corrosion protection is due to the electrophoretic dip painting process which cathodically deposits paint particles on all body parts, attracting paint particles into the minutest cavities or seams. Body parts are designed to provide optimum corrosion protection. \n\nDuring manufacture, metal exterior body parts receive an additional corrosion protection coat. Hood, trunk, doors and other body parts are coated with PVC and sealed from the outside. \n\nAll floor panels receive a resilient coating of PVC for maximum protection against damage due to stones, etc. \n\nCorrosion protection materials tested over many years are applied to the surfaces of cavities and to the entire underside of the vehicle during and after assembly. \n\nFor additional information on the 12-year unlimited mileage anti-corrosion warranty see the Warranty Section of this Booklet (page 20). \n\nRestoring corrosion protection \n\nPlease take care that anti-corrosion material is replaced when your vehicle is repaired after body or chassis damage. \n\nBMW will not accept any liability for repair of, or damage caused by, any parts and accessories not approved by BMW. \n\nUnderbody maintenance \n\nThe underbody has to be cleaned at least once a year, in Spring, with plain water in order to remove mud, chemical sediments and other deposits.

The decision whether to repair or replace said parts is solely the prerogative of BMW NA and must be expected to correct the failure of the warranted part. Parts for which replacements are made become the property of BMW NA. In all cases, a reasonable time must be allowed for warranty repairs to be completed after the vehicle is received by the authorized BMW center. \n\nWarranty repairs do not constitute an extension of the original limited warranty period for the vehicle or a part thereof. \n\nFor assistance in determining which specific parts or components of your vehicle are covered under this warranty, please contact your authorized BMW center. \n\nIt is the owner's responsibility to have all scheduled inspection and maintenance services performed (at the owner's expense), as prescribed in the maintenance schedule for the BMW Emission Control System. Service intervals are computed by the onboard BMW Condition Based Service system and displayed on the instrument panel. The instructions for proper maintenance and use can be found in the Owner's Manual. It is strongly recommended that any replacement parts used for maintenance, repair or replacement of emission control systems be certified BMW Service Parts or BMW Authorized Remanufactured Parts. Without invalidating this warranty, the owner may elect to have maintenance, repair or replacement of the emission control systems performed by any automotive repair establishment, or elect to use parts other than certified BMW Service Parts. However, the cost of such service or parts will not be covered under this warranty, except in emergency situations. In an emergency situation, where an authorized BMW center or a warranty replacement part is not reasonably available (within 30 days), repairs may be performed at any available service establishment using any equivalent part. BMW NA will reimburse the owner for such emergency repairs (including labor, parts and diagnosis not to exceed BMW NA rates for labor, parts, and diagnosis in said area) that are covered under this warranty. Replaced parts and paid invoices must be presented at an authorized BMW center as a condition of reimbursement for emergency repairs not performed by an authorized BMW center. \n\nThe use of replacement parts, which are not of equivalent quality, may impair the effectiveness of the emission control system. If other than certified BMW Service Parts or Authorized Remanufactured Parts are used for maintenance, repair or replacement of components affecting emission control, the owner should obtain assurances that such parts are warranted by their manufacturer to be equivalent to genuine BMW parts in performance and durability. BMW NA assumes no liability under this warranty with respect to parts other than genuine BMW parts. \n\nHowever, the use of non-genuine BMW replacement parts or non-EPA certified parts does not invalidate the warranty on other components, unless non-genuine BMW parts or non-EPA certified parts cause damage to warranted parts. \n\nWhat is not covered \n\nThis warranty does not cover malfunctions caused by any of the following: accident, flood, misuse, improper adjustment, modification, alteration, tampering, disconnection, improper or inadequate maintenance, use of leaded fuel or fuels containing more than $10 \\%$ ethanol, or other oxygenates with more than $2 . 8 \\%$ oxygen by weight (i.e., more than $1 5 \\%$ MTBE or more than $3 \\%$ methanol plus an equivalent amount of co-solvent). \n\nThe replacement of maintenance parts, such as spark plugs, filters and similar items used in required maintenance services, the repair or replacement of maintenance parts beyond the first required inspection/maintenance, or if the part has been replaced earlier for reasons other than it being defective. \n\nThe vehicle or any part of the vehicle, unless a failure causes the vehicle to fail to conform to applicable emission regulations. \n\nAny vehicle on which the odometer has been replaced or altered and the true mileage cannot be determined. \n\nThe vehicle, if the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) is altered or cannot be read, or if the vehicle has been declared a total loss or sold for salvage purposes. \n\nGeneral \n\nThese warranties give you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights which vary from state to state. \n\nTHE DURATION OF ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, IS LIMITED TO THE DURATION OF THE EXPRESS WARRANTIES HEREIN. \n\nBMW NA HEREBY EXCLUDES INCIDENTAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOSS OF TIME, INCONVENIENCE, OR LOSS OF USE OF THE VEHICLE, FOR ANY BREACH OF ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, APPLICABLE TO THIS PRODUCT. \n\nSome states do not allow limitations on how long an implied warranty lasts, or the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitations and exclusions may not apply to you. Additionally, if you are a California, Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont or Washington resident and your vehicle is registered in that state, your vehicle is eligible for California Emissions Warranty coverage. \n\nThese federal warranty provisions also apply to all vehicles sold in all U.S. states and territories regardless of whether a state has enacted state warranty provisions that differ from the federal provisions. \n\nFederal Emissions Performance Warranty (Valid Only in the U.S.A. including Puerto Rico) \n\nIn those states and jurisdictions that have established periodic vehicle emissions tests to encourage proper vehicle maintenance and require the vehicle to pass an emissions test approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and: \n\n1. The vehicle was distributed by BMW of North America, LLC (BMW NA), or sold through the BMW NA European Delivery Program; and \n\n2. The vehicle has been maintained and operated in accordance with the instructions for proper maintenance and use set forth in the Owner's Manual supplied with the vehicle; and \n\n3. The vehicle fails to conform to the applicable emissions standards of the EPA as judged by an EPA approved emissions test; and \n\n4. The failure to conform results or will result in the owner of the vehicle having to bear a penalty or other sanction (including the denial of the right to use the vehicle) under local state or federal law if the nonconformity is not remedied within a specified period of time. \n\nThen, in accordance with the provisions of section 207(b) of the Clean Air Act, BMW NA warrants that if the vehicle is eligible for coverage under this warranty, any non-conformities in the vehicle, which cause it to fail an EPA-approved emissions test will, without charge for parts or labor (including diagnosis), be adjusted, repaired, or replaced, at the option of BMW NA to proper specifications, in order to make the vehicle comply with applicable emissions standards. The decision whether to adjust, repair or replace parts is solely the prerogative of BMW NA and must reasonably be expected to correct the failure of the warranted part. \n\nCoverage begins on the date of first retail sale or the date the vehicle is first placed into service as a sales demonstrator, Aftersales Mobility Program (AMP) Vehicle or company vehicle, whichever is earlier. This warranty continues for a period of 2 years or 24,000 miles, whichever occurs first, except for specific emissions control components (as listed on page 24), for which the warranty period is 8 years or 80,000 miles, whichever occurs first. \n\nThis warranty is made subject to the terms and conditions that apply to the Emission Control System Warranty and the New Vehicle Limited Warranty. \n\nWarranty repairs do not constitute an extension of the original limited warranty period for the vehicle or a part thereof. \n\nNo claim under this warranty will be denied on the basis of use of a properly installed EPA certified emission part for maintenance and repair. \n\nA vehicle manufacturer may deny an emission performance warranty claim on the basis of an uncertified replacement part used in the maintenance or repair of a vehicle only if the vehicle manufacturer presents evidence that the uncertified replacement part is either defective in materials or workmanship or not equivalent from an emission standpoint to the original equipment part. \n\nMaintenance, replacement, or repair of emission control devices and systems may be performed by any automotive repair establishment or individual using any certified part. \n\nImmediately after the vehicle has failed an EPA approved emission short test, your claim can be made at any authorized BMW center. The authorized BMW center will honor or deny your claim within the time period specified by local or state laws (not to exceed 30 days), to avoid further penalties or sanctions. If the claim is denied, the authorized BMW center will notify you in writing of the reason(s). The authorized BMW center is required by law to honor the claim if notice of denial is not received by the owner within the specified time period. \n\nYou may obtain further information concerning the emission warranties, or report violations of warranty terms, by contacting the Director, Field Operations and Support Division (6406J), Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street, SW, Washington, D.C. 20460. \n\nThe following systems are covered by the Federal Emission Performance Warranty for a period of 2-years or 24,000 miles, whichever occurs first.

BMW NA recommends that you retain all receipts covering maintenance on your vehicle, but BMW NA cannot deny warranty solely for the lack of receipts or for your failure to ensure the performance of all scheduled maintenance. \n\n- You are responsible for presenting your vehicle to an authorized BMW center as soon as a problem exists. The warranty repairs should be completed in a reasonable amount of time, not to exceed 30 days. \n\n- As the vehicle owner, you should also be aware that BMW NA may deny your warranty coverage if your vehicle or part has failed due to abuse, neglect, improper maintenance or unapproved modifications. \n\nIf you have any questions regarding your warranty rights and responsibilities, you should contact: \n\nBMW of North America, LLC   \nCustomer Relations and Services Department   \nP.O. Box 1227   \nWestwood, NJ 07675-1227 \n\nTelephone: 1 800 831-1117 \n\nEmail: customerrelations@bmwusa.com \n\nWebsite: www.bmwusa.com \n\nor the \n\nCalifornia Air Resources Board 9528 Telstar Avenue El Monte, CA 91731 \n\nCalifornia Emission Control System Limited Warranty\\* \n\nThis warranty applies to California certified vehicles distributed by BMW of North America, LLC (BMW NA) or sold through the BMW NA European Delivery Program, registered and operated primarily in California. \n\n\\*The California Emissions Control System Limited Warranty applies to all 2014 U.S.- specification BMW vehicles registered in California, Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont or Washington. \n\nBMW NA warrants to the original purchaser and each subsequent owner that the vehicle is: \n\na. designed, built and equipped so as to conform with the applicable California Air Resources Board emission standards. \n\nb. free from defects in materials and workmanship which cause any part that can affect emissions to fail to conform with applicable requirements or to fail a California Smog Check test or EPA approved short test for a period of 3 years or 50,000 miles, whichever occurs first. \n\nc. free from defects in materials and workmanship in emission related parts, which are contained in the California Emission Warranty Parts List on page 29, for a period of 8 years or 100,000 miles, whichever occurs first. \n\nCoverage begins on the date of first retail sale or the date the vehicle is first placed into service as a sales demonstrator, Aftersales Mobility Program (AMP) Vehicle or company vehicle, whichever is earlier. \n\nTo obtain service under this warranty, the vehicle must be brought, upon failure of a Smog Check test or upon discovery of the defect, to the workshop of any authorized BMW center, during normal business hours. The authorized BMW center will honor or deny your claim within 30 days. If the claim is denied, the authorized BMW center will notify you in writing of the \n\nreason(s). The authorized BMW center is required by law to honor the claim if notice is not given to the owner within 30 days. \n\nThe authorized BMW center will, without charge for parts or labor (including diagnosis), either adjust, repair or replace the defective part and other parts affected by the failure of the warranted part, if any. If your vehicle failed the California Smog Check test or an EPA approved short test, then BMW NA will repair your vehicle so that it will pass this test. Items that require scheduled replacement are warranted up to the replacement interval specified in the Service section of this Statement. BMW NA may repair a part in lieu of replacing it when performing warranty repairs. Parts for which replacements are made become the property of BMW NA. After 3 years or 50,000 miles, and in accordance with paragraph (c) above, such repairs are limited to the repair or replacement of those parts identified in the California Emissions Warranty List. \n\nIf your California registered vehicle is between 7 and 8 years old and has been driven less than 80,000 miles, then your vehicle is eligible for additional warranty coverage under the Federal Emissions Warranty. \n\nA repair performed as the result of a Smog Check test failure due to a defect in a part, which is warranted for 8 years/100,000 miles, is covered. \n\nWarranty repairs do not constitute an extension of the original limited warranty period for the vehicle or a part thereof. \n\nIn all cases, a reasonable time, not to exceed 30 days, must be allowed for a warranty repair to be completed, after the vehicle is received by the authorized BMW center. \n\nIt is the owner's responsibility to have all required maintenance services performed (at the owner's expense), as prescribed in the maintenance schedule for the BMW Emission Control System. Service intervals are computed by the Condition Based Service system and displayed on the instrument panel. \n\nHowever, BMW NA will not deny your warranty repair claims solely because you do not have maintenance records or you did not perform the required maintenance unless BMW NA demonstrates that such lack of required maintenance is a direct cause of the emission control system failure. The instructions for required maintenance and use can be found in the Owner's Manual and in the Service section of this Statement. \n\nIt is strongly recommended that any replacement parts used for maintenance, repair or replacement of emission control systems be genuine BMW Service Parts or BMW Authorized Remanufactured Parts. Without invalidating this warranty, the owner may elect to have maintenance, repair or replacement of the emission control systems performed by any automotive repair establishment, or elect to use parts other than BMW Authorized Remanufactured or genuine BMW Service Parts. However, the cost of such service or parts will not be covered under this warranty, except in emergency situations. In an emergency situation, where an authorized BMW center is not reasonably available or a warranty replacement par is not available within 30 days, repairs may be performed at any available service establishment or by any individual using any replacement part. \n\nA repair not completed within 30 days constitutes an emergency. BMW NÁ will reimburse the owner for such emergency repairs (including labor, parts and diagnosis not to exceed BMW suggested retail price for all warranted parts replaced and labor charges based on the manufacturer's recommended time allowance for the warranty repair and the geographically appropriate hourly labor rate) that are covered under this warranty. Replaced parts and paid invoices must be presented to an authorized BMW center as a condition of reimbursement for emergency repairs not performed by an authorized BMW center. \n\nThe use of replacement parts, which are not of equivalent quality, may impair the effectiveness of emission control systems. If other than genuine BMW Service Parts or Authorized Remanufactured Parts are used for maintenance, repair or replacement of components affecting emission control, the owner should obtain assurances that such parts are warranted by their manufacturer to be equivalent to genuine BMW parts in performance and durability. BMW NA assumes no liability under this warranty with respect to parts other than genuine BMW parts. \n\nHowever, the use of non-genuine BMW replacement parts does not invalidate the warranty on other components, unless non-genuine BMW parts cause damage to warranted parts. \n\nWhat is not covered \n\nThis warranty does not cover malfunctions caused by any of the following: accident, flood, misuse, modification, alteration, tampering, disconnection, improper or inadequate maintenance, except if performed by an authorized BMW center doing warranty repair work, use of leaded fuel or fuel other than as specified in the Owner's Manual. \n\nThe replacement of maintenance parts, such as spark plugs (gasoline engines only), filters and similar items used in required maintenance services or the repair or replacement of maintenance parts beyond the first replacement interval. \n\nAny vehicle on which the odometer has been replaced or altered and the true mileage cannot be determined. \n\nThe vehicle, if the Vehicle Identification Number (VIN) is altered or cannot be determined, or if the vehicle has been declared a total loss or sold for salvage purposes. \n\nGeneral \n\nThe warranty gives you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights which vary from state to state. \n\nTHE DURATION OF ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, IS LIMITED TO THE DURATION OF THE EXPRESS WARRANTIES HEREIN. \n\nBMW OF NORTH AMERICA, LLC (BMW NA) HEREBY EXCLUDES INCIDENTAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOSS OF TIME, INCONVENIENCE, OR LOSS OF USE OF THE VEHICLE, FOR ANY BREACH OF ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY, INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, APPLICABLE TO THIS PRODUCT. \n\nFor assistance in determining which parts are covered by this warranty, please contact your authorized BMW center or the BMW NA Customer Relations and Services Department at 1 800 831-1117.
